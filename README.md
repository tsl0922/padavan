This project is based on original rt-n56u with latest mtk 4.4.198 kernel, which is fetch from D-LINK GPL code.

##### Enhancements in this repo

- commits has beed rewritten on top of [hanwckf/rt-n56u](https://github.com/hanwckf/rt-n56u) repo for better history tracking
- Optimized Makefiles and build scripts, added a toplevel Makefile
- Added ccache support, may save up to 50%+ build time
- Upgraded the toolchain and libc:
  - gcc 12.3.0
  - uClibc-ng 1.0.43
 - Enabled kernel cgroups support
 - Fixed K2P led label names
 - Replaced udpxy with msd_lite
 - Replaced Web Console with ttyd
 - Upgraded libs and user packages
 - And a lot of package related fixes
 - ...

# Compilation steps

- Install dependencies
  ```sh
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt install unzip libtool-bin ccache curl cmake gperf gawk flex bison nano xxd \
      fakeroot kmod cpio git python3-docutils gettext automake autopoint \
      texinfo build-essential help2man pkg-config zlib1g-dev libgmp3-dev \
      libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libltdl-dev wget libc-dev-bin
  ```
  **Optional:**
  - install [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) for building go programs
  - install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for building [AdGuardHome](trunk/user/adguardhome)
- Clone source code
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/tsl0922/padavan.git
  ```
- Modify template file and start compiling
  ```sh
  # (Optional) Modify template file
  # vi trunk/configs/templates/K2P.config

  # Start compiling with: make PRODUCT_NAME
  make K2P

  # To build firmware for other devices, clean the tree after previous build
  make clean
  ```

# Package Development

- Makefile examples
  - [Makefile project](trunk/libs/libpcre/Makefile) 
  - [CMake project](trunk/user/ttyd/Makefile)
- Compiling a single package (cd to `trunk` first)
  - build: `make libs/libpcre_only`
  - clean: `make libs/libpcre_clean`
  - romfs: `make libs/libpcre_romfs`
