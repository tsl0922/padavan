E2fsprogs 1.29 (September 24, 2002)
===================================

Fixed a bug in e2fsck which could corrupt a directory when optimizing
it (via the -D option) or rebuilding the hash tree index with a 1 in
512 probability, due to a fence post error.

Fixed a bug in the LVM support code which caused LABEL='xxx' not to
work correctly.

Mke2fs now enables the directory indexing flag by default.  (Since
this is a compatible feature flag, it's safe to do so.)

Tune2fs will support setting the directory indexing feature flag.  It
will automatically set up the default hash algorithm and hash seed
fields in the superblock.

If the bone-headed user enters the root filesystem twice in
/etc/fstab, the -R option which skips the root filesystem will skip
all of them.  (Addresses Debian bug #159423).  Note!  This is not a
precedent for dealing intelligently with any other kind of doubled
entry in /etc/fstab!


Programmer's notes: 
-------------------

Removed perror declaration in lib/et/internal.h.  All modern systems
can be expected to define perror() these days.  Besides, the lib/et
code wasn't using perror at all anyway.  :-)
