E2fsprogs 1.22 (June 22, 2001)
==============================

Fixed a bug in e2fsck's handling of orphan inodes which are special
files (i.e., block/character device files, named FIFO's, etc.).

Fixed a bug accidentally introduced in e2fsprogs 1.21 which caused
tune2fs to fail at adding a journal to a mounted filesystem.

Fixed a few big-endian bugs in e2fsprogs
	* The directory block functions were accidentally reporting
		some directories as corrupted when they weren't.
	* If e2fsprogs is compiled --disable-swapfs, the C language 
		equivalents weren't being included for big-endian platforms.
		(Fixes Debian bug #101686).

Fixed a Hurd compilation problem.  (Addresses Debian bug #101361)

Programmer's notes:
-------------------

Use platform independent method of defining the BLKFLSBUF and FDFLUSH
ioctls, and allow them to be defined for non-i386 platforms.

The uuid.h header file is now protected against multiple inclusions.

E2fsprogs is now being developed using BitKeeper.  Changed the test
scripts to deal with BK's stripping CR characters from text files,
and changed the top-level Makefile.in to avoid including BitKeeper
files when generating the source tarball.
