E2fsprogs 1.17 (October 26, 1999)
=================================

Fixed nasty typo in fsck which caused parallelized fsck's to go into an
infinite loop.

Fixed a bug in fsck where it used strncmp to compare a binary UUID,
thus potentially causing problems if a binary UUID contained a NULL
character.

E2fsck now uses stricter checks for directory entries in pass 2:
zero-length filenames are not allowed; neither are 8 byte long
directory entries.

The debugfs "dirty" command now clears the filesystem valid bit.
(Previously this just set the dirty-as-in-needs-writing-out-to-disk
bit in the in-core superblock image.  The new functionality is more
what the user expects, and is more useful.)

Added a debugging hook to test parallel fsck; if the environment
variable FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL, then filesystems on the same drive
will be checked in parallel when they normally would not be.

Programmer's notes:
-------------------

Fixed some #ifdef's for compilation under the Hurd OS.

Fixed minor W2K compatibility problems.

Fixed some miscellaneous GCC warnings.
