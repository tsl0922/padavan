E2fsprogs 1.18 (November 10, 1999)
==================================

Fix a core dumping bug in e2fsck if an imagic inode is present or
(more rarely) if the filesystem is badly corrupted enough that e2fsck
has to restart pass 1 processing.  E2fsck now closes the filesystem
before freeing a large number of its data structures, so in the case
of future memory faults, at least the fixed filesystem will be fully
written out.

If a filesystem doesn't support imagic inodes, and e2fsck discovers an
imagic inode, it will offer to clear the imagic flag.

E2fsck will now offer to clear the immutable flag on special files
(device/socket/fifos) when running it in non-preen mode.

E2fsck will now set the filetype when creating /lost+found, and when
connected orphaned inodes to /lost+found.

Debugfs's ncheck and icheck commands now handles the case where there
are bad blocks in the inode table without bombing out.

The badblocks list processing code has been made more efficiently for
appending a large number of (ordered) badblocks to the badblocks list.

Some minor man page updates.

Fsck now allows interactive e2fsck's when using fsck -As (not a common
mode, but some people like to do this in boot scripts for silly reasons).

Programmer's notes:
-------------------

The internal e2fsck problem code for PR_2_SPLIT_DOT was fixed to meet
with the problem code convention.

The badblocks list regression test program has been updated to work
with previously made API name changes.

The ext2fs_free() command now uses the new badblocks API to avoid
using the compatibility layer.

Added new regression test cases; the run_e2fsck test script now
supports the ability for a test case to run a preparatory command
before running e2fsck.
