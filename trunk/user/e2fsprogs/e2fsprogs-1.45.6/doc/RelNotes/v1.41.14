E2fsprogs 1.41.14 (December 22, 2010)
=====================================

Fix spurious complaint in mke2fs where it would complain if the file
system type "default" is not defined in mke2fs.conf.

The resize2fs program will no longer clear the resize_inode feature
when the number reserved group descriptor blocks reaches zero.  This
allows for subsequent shrinks of the file system to work cleanly for
flex_bg file systems.

The resize2fs program now handles devices which are exactly 16T;
previously it would give an error saying that the file system was too
big.

E2fsck (and the libext2fs library) will not use the extended rec_len
encoding for file systems whose block size is less than 64k, for
consistency with the kernel.

Programming notes
-----------------

E2fsprogs 1.41.13 would not compile on big-endian systems.  This has
been fixed.  (Addresses Sourceforge Bug: #3138115)

The ext2fs_block_iterator2() function passed an incorrect ref_offset
to its callback function in the case of sparse files.  (Addresses
Sourceforge Bug: #3081087)
    
Fix some type-punning warnings generated by newer versions of gcc.
