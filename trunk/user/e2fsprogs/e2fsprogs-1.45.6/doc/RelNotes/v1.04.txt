E2fsprogs 1.04 (May 16, 1996)
=============================

First "official" (1.03 was a limited release only) to support building
e2fsprogs under Linux 2.0 kernels (as well as late model 1.3 and 1.99
kernels).

This package includes a RPM specs file, that it can be built using the
RedHat Package Manager.

E2fsck now prints a hint that if there are lots of incorrectly located
inode bitmaps, block bitmaps, and inode table blocks, the user might
want to try using e2fsck -b 8193 first, to see if that fares any
better.

For ext2 filesystem written with the hurd, debugfs will now print out
the translator field when printing an inode structure.

Lots of miscellaneous linking/installation cleanups:

  Libraries are now linked using a relative pathname, instead of
  relying on -L working correct.  It doesn't, in many cases, including
  current versions of GNU ld.  This guarantees that the build tree is
  linking with the right libraries, instead of the ones installed in
  /usr/lib.

  Header files, man pages, and the et/ss shell scripts are now
  generated using a custom substitution script, instead of relying on
  the configure script.  This prevents needless recompilation of
  files; in addition, the custom substitution script is much faster.

  e2fsck may now be linked dynamically, by using the
  --enable-dynamic-e2fsck flag to configure.  This is not recommended,
  since it increases e2fsck's dependence on other files, but some
  people need to save disk space, and other critical programs on their
  systems were being linked dynamically anyway.

  Programs such as fsck which didn't need to be linked against
  libext2fs (or mke2fs which didn't need to be linked against libe2p)
  only link against libraries they actually need.  Otherwise, those
  programs would require the presence of libraries that otherwise
  could be removed from a rescue diskette.

  The ss include files are now installed correctly so they can
  actually be used by another package.

  If the profiling libraries are built, they are now installed on a
  "make install-libs".
