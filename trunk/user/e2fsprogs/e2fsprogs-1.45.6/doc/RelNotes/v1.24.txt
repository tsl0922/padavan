E2fsprogs 1.24a (September 2, 2001)
===================================

Fix brown-paper bug in mke2fs which caused it to segfault when
printing the version string.


E2fsprogs 1.24 (August 30, 2001)
================================

Revert the BLKGETSIZE64 support, since for some distributions, this
ioctl has been used by an unofficial kernel patch to update the last
sector on the disk, and this was causing disk corruption problems as a
result.

Mke2fs is now more careful about zapping swap space signatures and
other filesystem/raid superblock magic values so that programs like
mount who try to use heuristics to determine the filesystem type of a
partition are less likely to be confused.

E2fsck will no longer complain if the the mode of EXT2_RESIZE_INO is a
regular file (since Andreas Dilger's on-line resizing tools will set
its mode bits).

Fixed some minor texinfo, man pages nits for spelling errors,
texinfo warnings, etc.  (Addresses Debian bug #110621.)

E2fsprogs program no longer print the filesystem version number
(i.e. 0.5b), since it only confuses people and doesn't serve any real
purpose.

E2fsck will once again compile under libc5, since it will supply its
own version of strnlen if necessary.

mke2fs and tune2fs will allow the use of UUID= or LABEL= specifiers
when specifying the external journal device.  tune2fs will also search
devices looking for the external journal device when removing it.
