E2fsprogs 1.32 (November 9, 2002)
=================================

Fixed a bug in the Unix I/O routines which caused needless writebacks
of clean blocks from the unix_io cache (they were erroneously marked
as being dirty, so they were getting written back to disk before
getting evicted from the disk cache).  This was harmless, but it
significantly slowed down e2fsck.

Made some other minor optimizations to the Unix I/O routines to save a
small amount of CPU time.

Updated internationalization files.
