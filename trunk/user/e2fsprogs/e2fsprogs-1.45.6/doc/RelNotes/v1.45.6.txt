E2fsprogs 1.45.6 (March 20, 2020)
==================================

Updates/Fixes since v1.45.5:

UI and Features
---------------

Debugfs will ignore lines in its command files which start with a
comment character ("#").


Fixes
-----

Fixed a number of potential out of bounds memory accesses caused by
fuzzed / malicious file systems.  (Addresses Google Bug: #147849134)

Fix a spurious complaint from e2fsck when a directory which previously
had more than 32000 subdirectories has the number of subdirectories
drops below 32000.

Fix an ismounted check when an LVM device is renamed while the device is
mounted.

Mke2fs -d now correctly sets permission with files where the owner
permissions are not rwx.

Improve e2fsck's ability to deal with file systems with very large
number of directories, such that various data structures take more than
2GiB of memory.  Use better structure packing to improve the memory
efficiency of these data structures.

Fix debugfs so it correctly prints inode numbers > 2**31.

Filefrag now supports very large files (with > 4 billion blocks), as
well as block sizes up to 1 GiB.

Updated and clarified various man pages.  (Addresses Debian Bugs:
#953493, #953494, #951808)



Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Reserved the error code EXT2_ET_NO_GDESC (which will be used in
e2fsprogs v1.46+)

Added a thread-safe variant of e2p_feature2string(),
e2p_feature_to_string() to the libe2p library.

Fixed portability problems caused by gcc 10.

Fixed portability problem in libcom_err with GNU Hurd.

Fixed various Debian packaging issues.  (Addresses-Debian-Bug: #953926)
