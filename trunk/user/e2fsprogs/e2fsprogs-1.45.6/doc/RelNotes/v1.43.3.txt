E2fsprogs 1.43.3 (September 4, 2016)
====================================

Fix e2fsck's handling of timestamps on 32-bit systems.

E2fsck will now check, and if necessary repair the extra isize fields
in the inode and superblock.

Fix crashes on architectures such as sparc64 that are sensitive to
unaligned pointer dereferences in the journal recovery code when
journal checksums are enabled.

Programming notes
-----------------

Support reproducible builds by not capturing the build directory into
the mk_cmds and compile_et scripts.  Also fix debian build rules to
ensure build reproducibility.

Fix debian build rules to ensure build reproducibility and to avoid
hiding the linker flags for e2fsck.static so the build hardening log
scanner can properly audit the build.

Fix compatibility with FreeBSD's pmake and teach the configure script
to force the creation of pmake-compatible Makefiles if the
FORCE_NATIVE_MAKE environment variable is set to a non-empty value.
