E2fsprogs 1.27 (March 8, 2002)
==============================

The warning messages for mke2fs now go to standard error.

Fixed to make sure "make check" runs all of the test programs with
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, so that we test the libraries in the build tree.

The mke2fs program checks the boot sector for the BSD disk label, and
avoids erasing it if it is there.

Fixed a bug in e2fsck which caused it to core dump if the journal
inode was missing when it was supposed to be there.

E2fsck now prints ranges in pass 5 when printing deltas for the block
and inode bitmaps.

Debugfs's "ls -l" command now will print out the file type information
in the directory entry.

Create man pages and hard links for fsck.ext3 and mkfs.ext3.  If
mke2fs is invoked as mkfs.ext3, create the filesystem with a journal.

Debugfs can now examine the experimental directory indexing
information.

Fixed bug in debugfs which caused it to core dump if modify_inode is
called without an open filesystem.

The debugfs lsdel command now runs its output through a pager first.

When installing manual pages, remove the compressed manual pages first.

Synchronized with Debian's packaging information for e2fsprogs-1.26-1.

Fix the 2.4 resource limitation workaround introduced in 1.26 which
actually broke things on mips32, sparc32, and Alpha platforms.

Updated the I18N code so that calls to setlocate(LC_CTYPE, 0) are made
(which is required by the newer libintl libraries).

Programmer's notes:
-------------------

Fixed various gcc -Wall complaints.

Fixed a few memory leaks in the e2fsck journalling code, and in the
ismounted code checking for a swap device.

Add new inode I/O abstraction interface which exports an inode as
an I/O object.
  
Exported ext2_file_flush as a public interface.
  
In ext2_file_write, we now mark the buffer void * argument as a const, since ext2_file_write doesn't modify the buffer.

Lots of small random portability fixes to make e2fsprogs build under
AIX --- even without the 5L compatibility toolkit, and even using the
uber-crippled AIX native C compiler.
