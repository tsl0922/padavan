E2fsprogs 1.03 (March 27, 1996)
===============================

Change the m68k bit numbering for bitmasks to match the bit numbering
used by all other ext2 implementations.  (This change was requested by
the m68k kernel development team.)

Support (in-development) filesystem format revision which supports
(among other things) dynamically sized inodes.

Fixed a bug in the ext2 library so that an intelligent error is
returned if mke2fs is run with a ridiculously small number of blocks
for a partition.

Fixed a bug in the ext2 library which required that the device be
openable in read/write mode in order to determine its size.  This
caused e2fsck -n to require read/write access when it was not
previously necessary.

Fixed a bug in e2fsck which caused it to occasionally fail the test
suite depending on which version of the floating point library it was
using.

Fixed a bug in e2fsck so that it now halts with a fatal error when
certain superblock consistency checks fail.  Previously it continued
running e2fsck, with some potential confusing/damaging consequences.

Added new flag to fsck which allows the root to be checked in parallel
with other filesystems.  This is not the safest thing in the world to
do, but some system administrators really wanted it.

Fixed -Wall flames in lib/ss.
