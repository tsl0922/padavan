E2fsprogs 1.43.9 (February 8, 2018)
===================================

Remove the huge file flag from libe2p (and hence from chattr/lsattr),
since it was never made visible by the kernel.  Remove the description
of some compression related flags, and add a description of the
encrypted file flag, and the project hierarchy flag.

Remove a misplaced "MNP is unsupported" message from debugfs.

Fix a build failure in lib/ext2fs/swapfs.c on big-endian systems.
(Addresses Debian Bug #886119)

Fix various Debian packaging issues.  (Addresses Debian Bug #269569).
