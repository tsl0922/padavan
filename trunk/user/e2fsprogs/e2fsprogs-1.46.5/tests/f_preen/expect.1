test_filesys: Note: if several inode or block bitmap blocks or part
of the inode table require relocation, you may wish to try
running e2fsck with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem
may lie only with the primary block group descriptors, and
the backup block group descriptors may be OK.

test_filesys: Block bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 0)


test_filesys: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
	(i.e., without -a or -p options)
Exit status is 4
