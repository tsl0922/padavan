ext2fs_check_desc: Corrupt group descriptor: bad block for inode bitmap
Note: if several inode or block bitmap blocks or part
of the inode table require relocation, you may wish to try
running e2fsck with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem
may lie only with the primary block group descriptors, and
the backup block group descriptors may be OK.

Inode bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 4000)
Relocate? yes

Filesystem did not have a UUID; generating one.

Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Relocating group 0's inode bitmap to 4...
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Inode bitmap differences:  +(1--11)
Fix? yes

Padding at end of inode bitmap is not set. Fix? yes
