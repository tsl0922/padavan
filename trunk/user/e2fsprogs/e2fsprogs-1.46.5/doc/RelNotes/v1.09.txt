E2fsprogs 1.09 (April 14, 1997)
===============================

Fixed bug in mke2fs (really in lib/ext2fs/initialize.c) which was
accidentally introduced in the 1.08 release.  The overhead calculation
was accidentally removed, which caused ext2fs_initialize() to not
notice when the filesystem size needed to be adjusted down because
there wasn't enough space in the last block group.

Fixed bug in version parsing library routine; it was always parsing
the library version string, instead of using the passed-in string.

Clarified chattr man page.
