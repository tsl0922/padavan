E2fsprogs 1.14 (January 9, 1999)
================================

Fix the fstab parsing code so that it can handle blank lines and
comment characters.  Also, missing pass numbers need to be treated as
zero.

Fixed a bug in e2fsck where under some circumstances (when e2fsck
needs to restart processing after fixing an egregious inconsistency)
it would try to access already freed memory.

E2fsck now prints non-printable characters in directory entries and
pathnames using '^' and 'M-' notation.

Fixed chattr so that it will ignore symbolic links when doing
recursive descent traversals.  For both chattr and lsattr, no longer
print the version string unless the -V option is given.

Allow the system administrator to directly specify the number of
inodes desired in the filesystem, for some special cases where this is
necessary.

Fix portability problems so that e2fsprogs can be compiled under Linux
1.2 systems and Solaris systems.

Update the config.guess file with a more recent version that will
identify newer Linux platforms.

Programmer's notes
------------------

Ext2fs_read_inode and ext2fs_write_inode will now return an error if
an inode number of zero is passed to them.
