E2fsprogs 1.45.2 (May 27, 2019)
===============================

Updates/Fixes since v1.45.1:

Fixes
-----

Fixed various problems with how e2scrub_all is run from cron, when not
all of the required packages are installed, or there are no LVM devices
on the system.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #929186, #929287, #928977)

When mke2fs asks the user if she should proceed, fall back to the
English 'y' or 'Y' characters since there could be a missing translation
prompting the use of the English 'y' character.  (Addresses Debian Bug:
#907034)

Fix spurious complaint of blocks beyond i_size for verity files.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed various debian packaging issues.

Fixed "make install" failure when the cron.d directory does not exist.

Update the Czech, Malay, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukarainian
translations.  Add the new Portuguese translation.
