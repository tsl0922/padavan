.SH NAME
e2scrub - check the contents of a mounted ext[234] file system
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B
e2scrub [OPTION] MOUNTPOINT | DEVICE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B e2scrub
attempts to check (but not repair) all metadata in a mounted ext[234]
file system if the file system resides on an LVM logical volume.
The block device of the LVM logical volume can also be passed in.

This program snapshots the volume and runs a file system check on the snapshot
to look for corruption errors.
The LVM volume group must have at least 256MiB of unallocated space to
dedicate to the snapshot or the logical volume will be skipped.
The snapshot will be named
.IR lvname ".e2scrub"
and
.B udev
will not create symbolic links to it under
.IR /dev/disk .
Every attempt will be made to remove the snapshots prior to running
.BR e2scrub ,
but in a dire situation it may be necessary to remove the snapshot manually.

If no errors are found,
.B fstrim
can be called on the file system if it is mounted.
If errors are found, the file system will be marked as having errors.
The file system should be taken offline and
.B e2fsck
run as soon as possible, because
.B e2scrub
does not fix corruptions.
If the file system is not repaired,
.B e2fsck
will be run before the next mount.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Print what commands
.B e2scrub
would execute to check the file system.  (Note: the commands will not
actually be executed; however, since
.B e2scrub
needs to run some commands to query the system to determine what
commands would be executed, it still needs to be run as root.)
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Remove the e2scrub snapshot and exit without checking anything.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Run
.B
fstrim(1)
on the mounted file system if no errors are found.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Print version information and exit.
.SH EXIT CODE
The exit codes are the same as in
.BR e2fsck (8)
