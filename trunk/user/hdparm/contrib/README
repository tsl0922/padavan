Dear Mark,

attached I send you a small patch for hdparm-3.5 to make use of the 
ioctls HDIO_UNREGISTER_HWIF and HDIO_SCAN_HWIF found in newer kernels.

With this patched version I can make my IBM ThinkPad 600E recognize 
'hot-swapped' ide-devices in its UltraBay II - slot. Together with 
tpctl-0.7.0 and the two scripts 'idectl' and 'ultrabayd' it works 
really nice.
