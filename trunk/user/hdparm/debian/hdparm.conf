## This is the default configuration for hdparm for Debian.  It is a 
## rather simple script, so please follow the following guidelines :)
## Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you 
## like.  Note that an in-line comment is not supported.  If a line 
## consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will be
## ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE
## IS PARSED!!  This means that lines with stray characters or lines that 
## use non # comment characters will be interpreted by the initscript.  
## This has probably minor, but potentially serious, side effects for your 
## hard drives, so please follow the guidelines.  Patches to improve 
## flexibilty welcome.  Please read /usr/share/doc/hdparm/README.Debian for 
## notes about known issues, especially if you have an MD array.
##
## Note that if the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm' 
## on the kernel command line, and the script will not be run.
##
## Uncommenting the options below will cause them to be added to the DEFAULT
## string which is prepended to options listed in the blocks below.
##
## If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.
##
## /sbin/hdparm is not run unless a block of the form:
##      DEV {
##         option
##         option
##         ...
##      }
## exists.  This blocks will cause /sbin/hdparm OPTIONS DEV to be run.
## Where OPTIONS is the concatenation of all options previously defined
## outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.

## New note - you can use straight hdparm commands in this config file 
## as well - the set up is ugly, but it keeps backwards compatibility
## Additionally, it should be noted that any blocks that begin with 
## the keyword 'command_line' are not run until after the root filesystem
## is mounted.  This is done to avoid running blocks twice.  If you need 
## to run hdparm to set parameters for your root disk, please use the 
## standard format.

#Samples follow:
#First three are good for devfs systems, fourth one for systems that do 
#not use devfs.  The fifth example uses straight hdparm command line
#syntax.  Any of the blocks that use command line syntax must begin with
#the keyword 'command_line', and no attempt is made to validate syntax.  
#It is provided for those more comfortable with hdparm syntax.
