hdparm.conf \- Debian configuration file for hdparm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
This is the default configuration for hdparm for Debian.
It is a rather simple script, so please follow the following guidelines :)
Any line that begins with a comment is ignored \- add as many as you 
like.
.LP
Note that an in\-line comment is not supported.  If a line 
consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will be
ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE
IS PARSED!!
.LP
This means that lines with stray characters or lines that 
use non # comment characters will be interpreted by the initscript.
This has probably minor, but potentially serious, side effects for your 
hard drives, so please follow the guidelines.
Patches to improve flexibilty welcome.
.LP
Please read /usr/share/doc/hdparm/README.Debian for 
notes about known issues, especially if you have an MD array.
.LP
Note that if the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm' 
on the kernel command line, and the script will not be run.
.LP
Setting an option outside of one of the stanzas enables it for all drives.
.LP
If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.
.LP
/sbin/hdparm is not run unless a block of the form:
.LP
.B
DEV {
.TP
option
.TP
option
.TP
}
.LP
exists.
This blocks will cause /sbin/hdparm OPTIONS DEV to be run.
Where OPTIONS is the concatenation of all options previously defined
outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.

Root file systems.
Please see README.Debian for details.
ROOTFS = /dev/hda
.PP
You can use straight hdparm commands in this config file 
as well \- the set up is ugly, but it keeps backwards compatibility.
Additionally, it should be noted that any blocks that begin with 
the keyword 'command_line' are not run until after the root filesystem
is mounted.
This is done to avoid running blocks twice.  If you need 
to run hdparm to set parameters for your root disk, please use the 
standard format.
