This target is used to redirect the traffic to the IMQ driver and you can apply
QoS rules like HTB or CBQ.
For example you can select only traffic comming from a specific interface or
is going out on a specific interface.
Also it permits to capture the traffic BEFORE NAT in the case of outgoing traffic
or AFTER NAT in the case of incomming traffic.

Set the IMQ interface where to send this traffic
.TP
Example:
.TP
Redirect incomming traffic from interface eth0 to imq0 and outgoing traffic to imq1:
iptables \-t mangle \-A FORWARD \-i eth0 \-j IMQ \-\-to\-dev 0
iptables \-t mangle \-A FORWARD \-o eth0 \-j IMQ \-\-to\-dev 1
