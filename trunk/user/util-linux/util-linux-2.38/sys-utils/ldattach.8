.SH "NAME"
ldattach \- attach a line discipline to a serial line
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBldattach\fP [\fB\-1278denoVh\fP] [\fB\-i\fP \fIiflag\fP] [\fB\-s\fP \fIspeed\fP] \fIldisc device\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBldattach\fP daemon opens the specified \fIdevice\fP file (which should refer to a serial device) and attaches the line discipline \fIldisc\fP to it for processing of the sent and/or received data. It then goes into the background keeping the device open so that the line discipline stays loaded.
.sp
The line discipline \fIldisc\fP may be specified either by name or by number.
.sp
In order to detach the line discipline, \fBkill\fP(1) the \fBldattach\fP process.
.sp
With no arguments, \fBldattach\fP prints usage information.
.SH "LINE DISCIPLINES"
.sp
Depending on the kernel release, the following line disciplines are supported:
.sp
\fBTTY\fP(\fB0\fP)
.RS 4

.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-1\fP, \fB\-\-onestopbit\fP
.RS 4
Set the number of stop bits of the serial line to one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-2\fP, \fB\-\-twostopbits\fP
.RS 4
Set the number of stop bits of the serial line to two.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-7\fP, \fB\-\-sevenbits\fP
.RS 4
Set the character size of the serial line to 7 bits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-8\fP, \fB\-\-eightbits\fP
.RS 4
Set the character size of the serial line to 8 bits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-debug\fP
.RS 4
Keep \fBldattach\fP in the foreground so that it can be interrupted or debugged, and to print verbose messages about its progress to standard error output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-evenparity\fP
.RS 4
Set the parity of the serial line to even.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-iflag\fP \fIvalue\fP...
.RS 4
Set the specified bits in the c_iflag word of the serial line. The given \fIvalue\fP may be a number or a symbolic name. If \fIvalue\fP is prefixed by a minus sign, the specified bits are cleared instead. Several comma\-separated values may be given in order to set and clear multiple bits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-noparity\fP
.RS 4
Set the parity of the serial line to none.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-oddparity\fP
.RS 4
Set the parity of the serial line to odd.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-speed\fP \fIvalue\fP
.RS 4
Set the speed (the baud rate) of the serial line to the specified \fIvalue\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-intro\-command\fP \fIstring\fP
.RS 4
Define an intro command that is sent through the serial line before the invocation of \fBldattach\fP. E.g. in conjunction with line discipline GSM0710, the command \(aqAT+CMUX=0\(rsr\(aq is commonly suitable to switch the modem into the CMUX mode.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pause\fP \fIvalue\fP
.RS 4
Sleep for \fIvalue\fP seconds before the invocation of \fBldattach\fP. Default is one second.
