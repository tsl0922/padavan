== NAME

switch_root - switch to another filesystem as the root of the mount tree

== SYNOPSIS

*switch_root* [*-hV*]

*switch_root* _newroot init_ [_arg_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*switch_root* moves already mounted _/proc_, _/dev_, _/sys_ and _/run_ to _newroot_ and makes _newroot_ the new root filesystem and starts _init_ process.

*WARNING: switch_root removes recursively all files and directories on the current root filesystem.*

== OPTIONS

include::man-common/help-version.adoc[]

== EXIT STATUS

*switch_root* returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.

== NOTES

*switch_root* will fail to function if _newroot_ is not the root of a mount. If you want to switch root into a directory that does not meet this requirement then you can first use a bind-mounting trick to turn any directory into a mount point:

....
mount --bind $DIR $DIR
....
