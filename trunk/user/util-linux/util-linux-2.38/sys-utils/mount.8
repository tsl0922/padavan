.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at \fI/\fP. These files can be spread out over several devices. The \fBmount\fP command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely, the \fBumount\fP(8) command will detach it again. The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device or provided in a virtual way by network or other services.
.sp
The standard form of the \fBmount\fP command is:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-t\fP \fItype device dir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on \fIdevice\fP (which is of type \fItype\fP) at the directory \fIdir\fP. The option \fB\-t\fP \fItype\fP is optional. The \fBmount\fP command is usually able to detect a filesystem. The root permissions are necessary to mount a filesystem by default. See section "Non\-superuser mounts" below for more details. The previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of \fIdir\fP become invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted, the pathname \fIdir\fP refers to the root of the filesystem on \fIdevice\fP.
.sp
If only the directory or the device is given, for example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount\fP \fI/dir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
then \fBmount\fP looks for a mountpoint (and if not found then for a device) in the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file. It\(cqs possible to use the \fB\-\-target\fP or \fB\-\-source\fP options to avoid ambiguous interpretation of the given argument. For example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-target\fP \fI/mountpoint\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The same filesystem may be mounted more than once, and in some cases (e.g., network filesystems) the same filesystem may be mounted on the same mountpoint multiple times. The \fBmount\fP command does not implement any policy to control this behavior. All behavior is controlled by the kernel and it is usually specific to the filesystem driver. The exception is \fB\-\-all\fP, in this case already mounted filesystems are ignored (see \fB\-\-all\fP below for more details).
.SS "Listing the mounts"
.sp
The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.
.sp
For more robust and customizable output use \fBfindmnt\fP(8), \fBespecially in your scripts\fP. Note that control characters in the mountpoint name are replaced with \(aq?\(aq.
.sp
The following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type \fItype\fP):
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount\fP [\fB\-l\fP] [\fB\-t\fP \fItype\fP]
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The option \fB\-l\fP adds labels to this listing. See below.
.SS "Indicating the device and filesystem"
.sp
Most devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special device), like \fI/dev/sda1\fP, but there are other possibilities. For example, in the case of an NFS mount, \fIdevice\fP may look like \fIknuth.cwi.nl:/dir\fP.
.sp
The device names of disk partitions are unstable; hardware reconfiguration, and adding or removing a device can cause changes in names. This is the reason why it\(cqs strongly recommended to use filesystem or partition identifiers like UUID or LABEL. Currently supported identifiers (tags):
.sp
LABEL=\fIlabel\fP
.RS 4
Human readable filesystem identifier. See also \fB\-L\fP.
.RE
.sp
UUID=\fIuuid\fP
.RS 4
Filesystem universally unique identifier. The format of the UUID is usually a series of hex digits separated by hyphens. See also \fB\-U\fP.
.sp
Note that \fBmount\fP uses UUIDs as strings. The UUIDs from the command line or from \fBfstab\fP(5) are not converted to internal binary representation. The string representation of the UUID should be based on lower case characters.
.RE
.sp
PARTLABEL=\fIlabel\fP
.RS 4
Human readable partition identifier. This identifier is independent on filesystem and does not change by \fBmkfs\fP or \fBmkswap\fP operations. It\(cqs supported for example for GUID Partition Tables (GPT).
.RE
.sp
PARTUUID=\fIuuid\fP
.RS 4
Partition universally unique identifier. This identifier is independent on filesystem and does not change by \fBmkfs\fP or \fBmkswap\fP operations. It\(cqs supported for example for GUID Partition Tables (GPT).
.RE
.sp
ID=\fIid\fP
.RS 4
Hardware block device ID as generated by udevd. This identifier is usually based on WWN (unique storage identifier) and assigned by the hardware manufacturer. See \fBls /dev/disk/by\-id\fP for more details, this directory and running udevd is required. This identifier is not recommended for generic use as the identifier is not strictly defined and it depends on udev, udev rules and hardware.
.RE
.sp
The command \fBlsblk \-\-fs\fP provides an overview of filesystems, LABELs and UUIDs on available block devices. The command \fBblkid \-p <device>\fP provides details about a filesystem on the specified device.
.sp
Don\(cqt forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device. Use \fBlsblk \-o +UUID,PARTUUID\fP to verify that the UUIDs are really unique in your system.
.sp
The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g. \fBUUID\fP=\fIuuid\fP) rather than \fI/dev/disk/by\-{label,uuid,id,partuuid,partlabel}\fP udev symlinks in the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file. Tags are more readable, robust and portable. The \fBmount\fP(8) command internally uses udev symlinks, so the use of symlinks in \fI/etc/fstab\fP has no advantage over tags. For more details see \fBlibblkid\fP(3).
.sp
The \fIproc\fP filesystem is not associated with a special device, and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword \- for example, \fIproc\fP \- can be used instead of a device specification. (The customary choice \fInone\fP is less fortunate: the error message \(aqnone already mounted\(aq from \fBmount\fP can be confusing.)
.SS "The files /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts"
.sp
The file \fI/etc/fstab\fP (see \fBfstab\fP(5)), may contain lines describing what devices are usually mounted where, using which options. The default location of the \fBfstab\fP(5) file can be overridden with the \fB\-\-fstab\fP \fIpath\fP command\-line option (see below for more details).
.sp
The command
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-a\fP [\fB\-t\fP \fItype\fP] [\fB\-O\fP \fIoptlist\fP]
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in \fIfstab\fP (of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line contains the \fBnoauto\fP keyword. Adding the \fB\-F\fP option will make \fBmount\fP fork, so that the filesystems are mounted in parallel.
.sp
When mounting a filesystem mentioned in \fIfstab\fP or \fImtab\fP, it suffices to specify on the command line only the device, or only the mount point.
.sp
The programs \fBmount\fP and \fBumount\fP(8) traditionally maintained a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file \fI/etc/mtab\fP. The support for regular classic \fI/etc/mtab\fP is completely disabled at compile time by default, because on current Linux systems it is better to make \fI/etc/mtab\fP a symlink to \fI/proc/mounts\fP instead. The regular \fImtab\fP file maintained in userspace cannot reliably work with namespaces, containers and other advanced Linux features. If the regular \fImtab\fP support is enabled, then it\(cqs possible to use the file as well as the symlink.
.sp
If no arguments are given to \fBmount\fP, the list of mounted filesystems is printed.
.sp
If you want to override mount options from \fI/etc/fstab\fP, you have to use the \fB\-o\fP option:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount\fP \fIdevice\fP|\fIdir\fP \fB\-o\fP \fIoptions\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
and then the mount options from the command line will be appended to the list of options from \fI/etc/fstab\fP. This default behaviour can be changed using the \fB\-\-options\-mode\fP command\-line option. The usual behavior is that the last option wins if there are conflicting ones.
.sp
The \fBmount\fP program does not read the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file if both \fIdevice\fP (or LABEL, UUID, ID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and \fIdir\fP are specified. For example, to mount device \fBfoo\fP at \fB/dir\fP:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount /dev/foo /dir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This default behaviour can be changed by using the \fB\-\-options\-source\-force\fP command\-line option to always read configuration from \fIfstab\fP. For non\-root users \fBmount\fP always reads the \fIfstab\fP configuration.
.SS "Non\-superuser mounts"
.sp
Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when \fIfstab\fP contains the \fBuser\fP option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding filesystem.
.sp
Thus, given a line
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fB/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted CDROM using the command:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount /cd\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
Note that \fBmount\fP is very strict about non\-root users and all paths specified on command line are verified before \fIfstab\fP is parsed or a helper program is executed. It\(cqs strongly recommended to use a valid mountpoint to specify filesystem, otherwise \fBmount\fP may fail. For example it\(cqs a bad idea to use NFS or CIFS source on command line.
.sp
Since util\-linux 2.35, \fBmount\fP does not exit when user permissions are inadequate according to libmount\(cqs internal security rules. Instead, it drops suid permissions and continues as regular non\-root user. This behavior supports use\-cases where root permissions are not necessary (e.g., fuse filesystems, user namespaces, etc).
.sp
For more details, see \fBfstab\fP(5). Only the user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it again. If any user should be able to unmount it, then use \fBusers\fP instead of \fBuser\fP in the \fIfstab\fP line. The \fBowner\fP option is similar to the \fBuser\fP option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for \fI/dev/fd\fP if a login script makes the console user owner of this device. The \fBgroup\fP option is similar, with the restriction that the user must be a member of the group of the special file.
.SS "Bind mount operation"
.sp
Remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-bind\fP \fIolddir newdir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
or by using this \fIfstab\fP entry:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fB/\fP\fIolddir\fP \fB/\fP\fInewdir\fP \fBnone bind\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
After this call the same contents are accessible in two places.
.sp
It is important to understand that "bind" does not create any second\-class or special node in the kernel VFS. The "bind" is just another operation to attach a filesystem. There is nowhere stored information that the filesystem has been attached by a "bind" operation. The \fIolddir\fP and \fInewdir\fP are independent and the \fIolddir\fP may be unmounted.
.sp
One can also remount a single file (on a single file). It\(cqs also possible to use a bind mount to create a mountpoint from a regular directory, for example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-bind foo foo\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible submounts. The entire file hierarchy including submounts can be attached a second place by using:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-rbind\fP \fIolddir newdir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
Note that the filesystem mount options maintained by the kernel will remain the same as those on the original mount point. The userspace mount options (e.g., _netdev) will not be copied by \fBmount\fP and it\(cqs necessary to explicitly specify the options on the \fBmount\fP command line.
.sp
Since util\-linux 2.27 \fBmount\fP permits changing the mount options by passing the relevant options along with \fB\-\-bind\fP. For example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-o bind,ro foo foo\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is implemented in userspace by an additional \fBmount\fP(2) remounting system call. This solution is not atomic.
.sp
The alternative (classic) way to create a read\-only bind mount is to use the remount operation, for example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-bind\fP \fIolddir newdir\fP
.sp
\fBmount \-o remount,bind,ro\fP \fIolddir newdir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
Note that a read\-only bind will create a read\-only mountpoint (VFS entry), but the original filesystem superblock will still be writable, meaning that the \fIolddir\fP will be writable, but the \fInewdir\fP will be read\-only.
.sp
It\(cqs also possible to change nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime, nodiratime, relatime and nosymfollow VFS entry flags via a "remount,bind" operation. The other flags (for example filesystem\-specific flags) are silently ignored. It\(cqs impossible to change mount options recursively (for example with \fB\-o rbind,ro\fP).
.sp
Since util\-linux 2.31, \fBmount\fP ignores the \fBbind\fP flag from \fI/etc/fstab\fP on a \fBremount\fP operation (if \fB\-o remount\fP is specified on command line). This is necessary to fully control mount options on remount by command line. In previous versions the bind flag has been always applied and it was impossible to re\-define mount options without interaction with the bind semantic. This \fBmount\fP behavior does not affect situations when "remount,bind" is specified in the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file.
.SS "The move operation"
.sp
Move a \fBmounted tree\fP to another place (atomically). The call is:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBmount \-\-move\fP \fIolddir newdir\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This will cause the contents which previously appeared under \fIolddir\fP to now be accessible under \fInewdir\fP. The physical location of the files is not changed. Note that \fIolddir\fP has to be a mountpoint.
.sp
Note also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is invalid and unsupported. Use \fBfindmnt \-o TARGET,PROPAGATION\fP to see the current propagation flags.
.SS "Shared subtree operations"
.sp
Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount provides the ability to create mirrors of that mount such that mounts and unmounts within any of the mirrors propagate to the other mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its master, but not vice versa. A private mount carries no propagation abilities. An unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot be cloned through a bind operation. The detailed semantics are documented in \fIDocumentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt\fP file in the kernel source tree; see also \fBmount_namespaces\fP(7).
.sp
Supported operations are:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mount \-\-make\-shared mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-slave mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-private mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-unbindable mountpoint
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The following commands allow one to recursively change the type of all the mounts under a given mountpoint.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mount \-\-make\-rshared mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-rslave mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-rprivate mountpoint
mount \-\-make\-runbindable mountpoint
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fBmount\fP \fBdoes not read\fP \fBfstab\fP(5) when a \fB\-\-make\-\fP* operation is requested. All necessary information has to be specified on the command line.
.sp
Note that the Linux kernel does not allow changing multiple propagation flags with a single \fBmount\fP(2) system call, and the flags cannot be mixed with other mount options and operations.
.sp
Since util\-linux 2.23 the \fBmount\fP command can be used to do more propagation (topology) changes by one \fBmount\fP(8) call and do it also together with other mount operations. The propagation flags are applied by additional \fBmount\fP(2) system calls when the preceding mount operations were successful. Note that this use case is not atomic. It is possible to specify the propagation flags in \fBfstab\fP(5) as mount options (\fBprivate\fP, \fBslave\fP, \fBshared\fP, \fBunbindable\fP, \fBrprivate\fP, \fBrslave\fP, \fBrshared\fP, \fBrunbindable\fP).
.sp
For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mount \-\-make\-private \-\-make\-unbindable /dev/sda1 /foo
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
is the same as:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mount /dev/sda1 /foo
mount \-\-make\-private /foo
mount \-\-make\-unbindable /foo
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
.sp
The full set of mount options used by an invocation of \fBmount\fP is determined by first extracting the mount options for the filesystem from the \fIfstab\fP table, then applying any options specified by the \fB\-o\fP argument, and finally applying a \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-w\fP option, when present.
.sp
The \fBmount\fP command does not pass all command\-line options to the \fB/sbin/mount.\fP\fIsuffix\fP mount helpers. The interface between \fBmount\fP and the mount helpers is described below in the \fBEXTERNAL HELPERS\fP section.
.sp
Command\-line options available for the \fBmount\fP command are:
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in \fIfstab\fP (except for those whose line contains the \fBnoauto\fP keyword). The filesystems are mounted following their order in \fIfstab\fP. The \fBmount\fP command compares filesystem source, target (and fs root for bind mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted filesystems. The kernel table with already mounted filesystems is cached during \fBmount \-\-all\fP. This means that all duplicated \fIfstab\fP entries will be mounted.
.sp
The correct functionality depends on \fI/proc\fP (to detect already mounted filesystems) and on \fI/sys\fP (to evaluate filesystem tags like UUID= or LABEL=). It\(cqs strongly recommended to mount \fI/proc\fP and \fI/sys\fP filesystems before \fBmount \-a\fP is executed, or keep /proc and /sys at the beginning of \fIfstab\fP.
.sp
The option \fB\-\-all\fP is possible to use for remount operation too. In this case all filters (\fB\-t\fP and \fB\-O\fP) are applied to the table of already mounted filesystems.
.sp
Since version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line option \fB\-o\fP to alter mount options from \fIfstab\fP (see also \fB\-\-options\-mode\fP).
.sp
Note that it is a bad practice to use \fBmount \-a\fP for \fIfstab\fP checking. The recommended solution is \fBfindmnt \-\-verify\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-bind\fP
.RS 4
Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available in both places). See above, under \fBBind mounts\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-no\-canonicalize\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt canonicalize paths. The \fBmount\fP command canonicalizes all paths (from the command line or \fIfstab\fP) by default. This option can be used together with the \fB\-f\fP flag for already canonicalized absolute paths. The option is designed for mount helpers which call \fBmount \-i\fP. It is strongly recommended to not use this command\-line option for normal mount operations.
.sp
Note that \fBmount\fP does not pass this option to the \fB/sbin/mount.\fP\fItype\fP helpers.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-fork\fP
.RS 4
(Used in conjunction with \fB\-a\fP.) Fork off a new incarnation of \fBmount\fP for each device. This will do the mounts on different devices or different NFS servers in parallel. This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in parallel. A disadvantage is that the order of the mount operations is undefined. Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both \fI/usr\fP and \fI/usr/spool\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f, \-\-fake\fP
.RS 4
Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it\(cqs not obvious, this "fakes" mounting the filesystem. This option is useful in conjunction with the \fB\-v\fP flag to determine what the \fBmount\fP command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries for devices that were mounted earlier with the \fB\-n\fP option. The \fB\-f\fP option checks for an existing record in \fI/etc/mtab\fP and fails when the record already exists (with a regular non\-fake mount, this check is done by the kernel).
.RE
.sp

.RS 4
Perform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified by \fIns\fP. \fIns\fP is either PID of process running in that namespace or special file representing that namespace.
.sp
\fBmount\fP switches to the mount namespace when it reads \fI/etc/fstab\fP, writes \fI/etc/mtab: (or writes to _/run/mount\fP) and calls \fBmount\fP(2), otherwise it runs in the original mount namespace. This means that the target namespace does not have to contain any libraries or other requirements necessary to execute the \fBmount\fP(2) call.

\fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-test\-opts\fP \fIopts\fP
.RS 4
Limit the set of filesystems to which the \fB\-a\fP option applies. In this regard it is like the \fB\-t\fP option except that \fB\-O\fP is useless without \fB\-a\fP. For example, the command
.sp
\fBmount \-a \-O no_netdev\fP
.sp
mounts all filesystems except those which have the option \fInetdev\fP specified in the options field in the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file.
.sp
It is different from \fB\-t\fP in that each option is matched exactly; a leading \fBno\fP at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.
.sp
The \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-O\fP options are cumulative in effect; that is, the command
.sp

\fB\-\-options\-mode\fP \fImode\fP

The option can be specified more than once. This option is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot scripts where additional configuration is specified beyond standard system configuration.
.sp
Note that \fBmount\fP does not pass the option \fB\-\-fstab\fP to the \fB/sbin/mount.\fP\fItype\fP helpers, meaning that the alternative \fIfstab\fP files will be invisible for the helpers. This is no problem for normal mounts, but user (non\-root) mounts always require \fIfstab\fP to verify the user\(cqs rights.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-types\fP \fIfstype\fP
.RS 4
The argument following the \fB\-t\fP is used to indicate the filesystem type. The filesystem types which are currently supported depend on the running kernel. See \fI/proc/filesystems\fP and \fI/lib/modules/$(uname \-r)/kernel/fs\fP for a complete list of the filesystems. The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.
.sp
The programs \fBmount\fP and \fBumount\fP(8) support filesystem subtypes. The subtype is defined by a \(aq.subtype\(aq suffix. For example \(aqfuse.sshfs\(aq. It\(cqs recommended to use subtype notation rather than add any prefix to the mount source (for example \(aqsshfs#example.com\(aq is deprecated).
.sp
If no \fB\-t\fP option is given, or if the \fBauto\fP type is specified, \fBmount\fP will try to guess the desired type. \fBmount\fP uses the \fBlibblkid\fP(3) library for guessing the filesystem type; if that does not turn up anything that looks familiar, \fBmount\fP will try to read the file \fI/etc/filesystems\fP, or, if that does not exist, \fI/proc/filesystems\fP. All of the filesystem types listed there will be tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g. \fIdevpts\fP, \fIproc\fP and \fInfs\fP). If \fI/etc/filesystems\fP ends in a line with a single *, mount will read \fI/proc/filesystems\fP afterwards. While trying, all filesystem types will be mounted with the mount option \fBsilent\fP.
.sp
The \fBauto\fP type may be useful for user\-mounted floppies. Creating a file \fI/etc/filesystems\fP can be useful to change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.
.sp
More than one type may be specified in a comma\-separated list, for the \fB\-t\fP option as well as in an \fI/etc/fstab\fP entry. The list of filesystem types for the \fB\-t\fP option can be prefixed with \fBno\fP to specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken. The prefix \fBno\fP has no effect when specified in an \fI/etc/fstab\fP entry.
.sp
The prefix \fBno\fP can be meaningful with the \fB\-a\fP option. For example, the command
.sp
\fBmount \-a \-t nomsdos,smbfs\fP
.sp
mounts all filesystems except those of type \fImsdos\fP and \fIsmbfs\fP.
.sp
For most types all the \fBmount\fP program has to do is issue a simple \fBmount\fP(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is required. For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program. In order to make it possible to treat all types in a uniform way, \fBmount\fP will execute the program \fB/sbin/mount.\fP\fItype\fP (if that exists) when called with type \fItype\fP. Since different versions of the \fBsmbmount\fP program have different calling conventions, \fB/sbin/mount.smbfs\fP may have to be a shell script that sets up the desired call.

Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the \fI/etc/fstab\fP file.

Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in the system kernel. To check the current setting see the options in \fI/proc/mounts\fP. Note that filesystems also have per\-filesystem specific default mount options (see for example \fBtune2fs \-l\fP output for ext\fIN\fP filesystems).
.sp

\fBcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP, \fBfscontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP, \fBdefcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP, and \fBrootcontext=\fP\fIcontext\fP
.RS 4
The \fBcontext=\fP option is useful when mounting filesystems that do not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not normally running under SELinux, such as an ext3 or ext4 formatted disk from a non\-SELinux workstation. You can also use \fBcontext=\fP on filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility with xattr\-supporting filesystems on earlier 2.4.<x> kernel versions. Even where xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to label every file by assigning the entire disk one security context.
.sp
A commonly used option for removable media is \fBcontext="system_u:object_r:removable_t\fP.
.sp
The \fBfscontext=\fP option works for all filesystems, regardless of their xattr support. The fscontext option sets the overarching filesystem label to a specific security context. This filesystem label is separate from the individual labels on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for certain kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or file creation. Individual file labels are still obtained from the xattrs on the files themselves. The context option actually sets the aggregate context that fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label for individual files.
.sp
You can set the default security context for unlabeled files using \fBdefcontext=\fP option. This overrides the value set for unlabeled files in the policy and requires a filesystem that supports xattr labeling.
.sp
The \fBrootcontext=\fP option allows you to explicitly label the root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode becomes visible to userspace. This was found to be useful for things like stateless Linux.
.sp
Note that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes the context option, \fBeven\fP when unchanged from the current context.
.sp
\fBWarning: the\fP \fIcontext\fP \fBvalue might contain commas\fP, in which case the value has to be properly quoted, otherwise \fBmount\fP will interpret the comma as a separator between mount options.

\fBremount\fP
.RS 4
Attempt to remount an already\-mounted filesystem. This is commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a readonly filesystem writable. It does not change device or mount point.
.sp
The remount operation together with the \fBbind\fP flag has special semantics. See above, the subsection \fBBind mounts\fP.
.sp
The remount functionality follows the standard way the \fBmount\fP command works with options from \fIfstab\fP. This means that \fBmount\fP does not read \fIfstab\fP (or \fImtab\fP) only when both \fIdevice\fP and \fIdir\fP are specified.
.sp
\fBmount \-o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir\fP
.sp
After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from \fIfstab\fP (or \fImtab\fP) is ignored, except the \fBloop=\fP option which is internally generated and maintained by the \fBmount\fP command.
.sp
\fBmount \-o remount,rw /dir\fP
.sp
After this call, \fBmount\fP reads \fIfstab\fP and merges these options with the options from the command line (\fB\-o\fP). If no mountpoint is found in \fIfstab\fP, then a remount with unspecified source is allowed.
.sp
\fBmount\fP allows the use of \fB\-\-all\fP to remount all already mounted filesystems which match a specified filter (\fB\-O\fP and \fB\-t\fP). For example:
.sp
\fBmount \-\-all \-o remount,ro \-t vfat\fP
.sp
remounts all already mounted vfat filesystems in read\-only mode. Each of the filesystems is remounted by \fBmount \-o remount,ro\fP \fI/dir\fP semantic. This means the \fBmount\fP command reads \fIfstab\fP or \fImtab\fP and merges these options with the options from the command line.

.SS "Mount options for devpts"
.sp
The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on \fI/dev/pts\fP. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens \fI/dev/ptmx\fP; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as \fI/dev/pts/\fP<number>.

This sets the owner or the group of newly created pseudo terminals to the specified values. When nothing is specified, they will be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.

All mounts of devpts without this \fBnewinstance\fP option share the same set of pseudo terminal indices (i.e., legacy mode). Each mount of devpts with the \fBnewinstance\fP option has a private set of pseudo terminal indices.
.sp
This option is mainly used to support containers in the Linux kernel. It is implemented in Linux kernel versions starting with 2.6.29. Further, this mount option is valid only if \fBCONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES\fP is enabled in the kernel configuration.
.sp

.RE
.RE
.sp
Decoding a non\-directory file handle may return a disconnected dentry. copy_up
of that disconnected dentry will create an upper index entry with no upper
alias.
.sp
When overlay filesystem has multiple lower layers, a middle layer directory may
have a "redirect" to lower directory. Because middle layer "redirects" are not
indexed, a lower file handle that was encoded from the "redirect" origin
directory, cannot be used to find the middle or upper layer directory.
Similarly, a lower file handle that was encoded from a descendant of the
"redirect" origin directory, cannot be used to reconstruct a connected overlay
path. To mitigate the cases of directories that cannot be decoded from a lower
file handle, these directories are copied up on encode and encoded as an upper
file handle. On an overlay filesystem with no upper layer this mitigation
cannot be used NFS export in this setup requires turning off redirect follow
(e.g. "\fIredirect_dir=nofollow\fP").
.sp
The overlay filesystem does not support non\-directory connectable file handles, so exporting with the \fIsubtree_check\fP exportfs configuration will cause failures to lookup files over NFS.
.sp
When the NFS export feature is enabled, all directory index entries are verified on mount time to check that upper file handles are not stale. This verification may cause significant overhead in some cases.
.sp
Note: the mount options \fIindex=off,nfs_export=on\fP are conflicting for a
read\-write mount and will result in an error.

\fBxino=\fP{\fBon\fP|\fBoff\fP|\fBauto\fP}
.RS 4
The "xino" feature composes a unique object identifier from the real object st_ino and an underlying fsid index. The "xino" feature uses the high inode number bits for fsid, because the underlying filesystems rarely use the high inode number bits. In case the underlying inode number does overflow into the high xino bits, overlay filesystem will fall back to the non xino behavior for that inode.

\fBmetacopy=\fP{\fBon\fP|\fBoff\fP}

When metadata only copy up feature is enabled, overlayfs will only copy up metadata (as opposed to whole file), when a metadata specific operation like chown/chmod is performed. Full file will be copied up later when file is opened for WRITE operation.

In other words, this is delayed data copy up operation and data is copied up when there is a need to actually modify data.
.RE
.sp
\fBvolatile\fP
.RS 4
Volatile mounts are not guaranteed to survive a crash. It is strongly recommended that volatile mounts are only used if data written to the overlay can be recreated without significant effort.
.sp
The advantage of mounting with the "volatile" option is that all forms of sync calls to the upper filesystem are omitted.
.sp
In order to avoid a giving a false sense of safety, the syncfs (and fsync) semantics of volatile mounts are slightly different than that of the rest of VFS. If any writeback error occurs on the upperdir’s filesystem after a volatile mount takes place, all sync functions will return an error. Once this condition is reached, the filesystem will not recover, and every subsequent sync call will return an error, even if the upperdir has not experience a new error since the last sync call.
.sp
When overlay is mounted with "volatile" option, the directory "$workdir/work/incompat/volatile" is created. During next mount, overlay checks for this directory and refuses to mount if present. This is a strong indicator that user should throw away upper and work directories and create fresh one. In very limited cases where the user knows that the system has not crashed and contents of upperdir are intact, The "volatile" directory can be removed.

Since util\-linux v2.29, \fBmount\fP re\-uses the loop device rather than initializing a new device if the same backing file is already used for some loop device with the same offset and sizelimit. This is necessary to avoid a filesystem corruption.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
\fBmount\fP has the following exit status values (the bits can be ORed):
.sp
\fB0\fP
.RS 4
success
.RE
.sp
\fB1\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp

.sp
The command \fBmount \-a\fP returns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all failed), or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).
.RE
.SH "EXTERNAL HELPERS"
.sp
The syntax of external mount helpers is:
.sp
\fB/sbin/mount.\fP\fIsuffix\fP \fIspec dir\fP [\fB\-sfnv\fP] [\fB\-N\fP \fInamespace\fP] [\fB\-o\fP \fIoptions\fP] [\fB\-t\fP \fItype\fP\fB.\fP\fIsubtype\fP]
.sp
where the \fIsuffix\fP is the filesystem type and the \fB\-sfnvoN\fP options have the same meaning as the normal mount options. The \fB\-t\fP option is used for filesystems with subtypes support (for example \fB/sbin/mount.fuse \-t fuse.sshfs\fP).
.sp
The command \fBmount\fP does not pass the mount options \fBunbindable\fP, \fBrunbindable\fP, \fBprivate\fP, \fBrprivate\fP, \fBslave\fP, \fBrslave\fP, \fBshared\fP, \fBrshared\fP, \fBauto\fP, \fBnoauto\fP, \fBcomment\fP, \fBx\-\fP*, \fBloop\fP, \fBoffset\fP and \fBsizelimit\fP to the mount.<suffix> helpers. All other options are used in a comma\-separated list as an argument to the \fB\-o\fP option.

A \fBmount\fP command existed in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.
.sp
Some Linux filesystems don\(cqt support \fB\-o sync\fP and \fB\-o dirsync\fP (the ext2, ext3, ext4, fat and vfat filesystems \fIdo\fP support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the \fBsync\fP option).
.sp
The \fB\-o remount\fP may not be able to change mount parameters (all \fIext2fs\fP\-specific parameters, except \fBsb\fP, are changeable with a remount, for example, but you can\(cqt change \fBgid\fP or \fBumask\fP for the \fIfatfs\fP).
.sp
It is possible that the files \fI/etc/mtab\fP and \fI/proc/mounts\fP don\(cqt match on systems with a regular \fImtab\fP file. The first file is based only on the \fBmount\fP command options, but the content of the second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g. on a remote NFS server \(em in certain cases the \fBmount\fP command may report unreliable information about an NFS mount point and the \fI/proc/mount\fP file usually contains more reliable information.) This is another reason to replace the \fImtab\fP file with a symlink to the \fI/proc/mounts\fP file.
.sp
Checking files on NFS filesystems referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the \fBfcntl\fP and \fBioctl\fP families of functions) may lead to inconsistent results due to the lack of a consistency check in the kernel even if the \fBnoac\fP mount option is used.
.sp
The \fBloop\fP option with the \fBoffset\fP or \fBsizelimit\fP options used may fail when using older kernels if the \fBmount\fP command can\(cqt confirm that the size of the block device has been configured as requested. This situation can be worked around by using the \fBlosetup\fP(8) command manually before calling \fBmount\fP with the configured loop device.
