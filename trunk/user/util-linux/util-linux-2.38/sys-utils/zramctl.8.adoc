== NAME

zramctl - set up and control zram devices

== SYNOPSIS

Get info: ::

*zramctl* [options]

Reset zram: ::

*zramctl* *-r* _zramdev_...

Print name of first unused zram device: ::

*zramctl* *-f*

Set up a zram device: ::

*zramctl* [*-f* | _zramdev_] [*-s* _size_] [*-t* _number_] [*-a* _algorithm_]

== DESCRIPTION

*zramctl* is used to quickly set up zram device parameters, to reset zram devices, and to query the status of used zram devices.

If no option is given, all non-zero size zram devices are shown.

Note that _zramdev_ node specified on command line has to already exist. The command *zramctl* creates a new _/dev/zram<N>_ nodes only when *--find* option specified. It's possible (and common) that after system boot _/dev/zram<N>_ nodes are not created yet.

== OPTIONS

*-a*, **--algorithm lzo**|**lz4**|**lz4hc**|**deflate**|**842**|**zstd**::
Set the compression algorithm to be used for compressing data in the zram device.

*-f*, *--find*::
Find the first unused zram device. If a *--size* argument is present, then initialize the device.

*-n*, *--noheadings*::
Do not print a header line in status output.

*-o*, *--output* _list_::
Define the status output columns to be used. If no output arrangement is specified, then a default set is used. Use *--help* to get a list of all supported columns.

*--output-all*::
Output all available columns.

*--raw*::
Use the raw format for status output.

*-r*, *--reset*::
Reset the options of the specified zram device(s). Zram device settings can be changed only after a reset.

*-s*, *--size* _size_::
Create a zram device of the specified _size_. Zram devices are aligned to memory pages; when the requested _size_ is not a multiple of the page size, it will be rounded up to the next multiple. When not otherwise specified, the unit of the _size_ parameter is bytes.
+
The _size_ argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

*-t*, *--streams* _number_::
Set the maximum number of compression streams that can be used for the device. The default is use all CPUs and one stream for kernels older than 4.6.

== EXIT STATUS

*zramctl* returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.

== FILES

_/dev/zram[0..N]_::
zram block devices

== EXAMPLE

The following commands set up a zram device with a size of one gigabyte and use it as swap device.

....
 # zramctl --find --size 1024M
 /dev/zram0
 # mkswap /dev/zram0
 # swapon /dev/zram0
 ...
 # swapoff /dev/zram0
 # zramctl --reset /dev/zram0
....
