.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBchcpu\fP can modify the state of CPUs. It can enable or disable CPUs, scan for new CPUs, change the CPU dispatching \fImode\fP of the underlying hypervisor, and request CPUs from the hypervisor (configure) or return CPUs to the hypervisor (deconfigure).
.sp
Some options have a \fIcpu\-list\fP argument. Use this argument to specify a comma\-separated list of CPUs. The list can contain individual CPU addresses or ranges of addresses. For example, \fB0,5,7,9\-11\fP makes the command applicable to the CPUs with the addresses 0, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-configure\fP \fIcpu\-list\fP
.RS 4
Configure the specified CPUs. Configuring a CPU means that the hypervisor takes a CPU from the CPU pool and assigns it to the virtual hardware on which your kernel runs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-disable\fP \fIcpu\-list\fP
.RS 4
Disable the specified CPUs. Disabling a CPU means that the kernel sets it offline.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-enable\fP \fIcpu\-list\fP
.RS 4
Enable the specified CPUs. Enabling a CPU means that the kernel sets it online. A CPU must be configured, see \fB\-c\fP, before it can be enabled.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-deconfigure\fP \fIcpu\-list\fP
.RS 4
Deconfigure the specified CPUs. Deconfiguring a CPU means that the hypervisor removes the CPU from the virtual hardware on which the Linux instance runs and returns it to the CPU pool. A CPU must be offline, see \fB\-d\fP, before it can be deconfigured.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-dispatch\fP \fImode\fP
.RS 4
Set the CPU dispatching \fImode\fP (polarization). This option has an effect only if your hardware architecture and hypervisor support CPU polarization. Available \fImodes\fP are:
.sp
\fBhorizontal\fP
.RS 4
The workload is spread across all available CPUs.
.RE
.sp
\fBvertical\fP
.RS 4
The workload is concentrated on few CPUs.
.RE
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-rescan\fP
.RS 4
Trigger a rescan of CPUs. After a rescan, the Linux kernel recognizes the new CPUs. Use this option on systems that do not automatically detect newly attached CPUs.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
