.SH "NAME"
nsenter \- run program in different namespaces
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBnsenter\fP [options] [\fIprogram\fP [\fIarguments\fP]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBnsenter\fP command executes \fIprogram\fP in the namespace(s) that are specified in the command\-line options (described below). If \fIprogram\fP is not given, then "${SHELL}" is run (default: \fI/bin/sh\fP).
.sp
Enterable namespaces are:
.sp
\fBmount namespace\fP
.RS 4
Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest of the system, except for filesystems which are explicitly marked as shared (with \fBmount \-\-make\-shared\fP; see \fI/proc/self/mountinfo\fP for the \fBshared\fP flag). For further details, see \fBmount_namespaces\fP(7) and the discussion of the \fBCLONE_NEWNS\fP flag in \fBclone\fP(2).
.RE
.sp
\fBUTS namespace\fP
.RS 4
Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of the system. For further details, see \fButs_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBIPC namespace\fP
.RS 4
The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX message queues as well as System V message queues, semaphore sets and shared memory segments. For further details, see \fBipc_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBnetwork namespace\fP
.RS 4
The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the \fI/proc/net\fP and \fI/sys/class/net\fP directory trees, sockets, etc. For further details, see \fBnetwork_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBPID namespace\fP
.RS 4
Children will have a set of PID to process mappings separate from the \fBnsenter\fP process. \fBnsenter\fP will fork by default if changing the PID namespace, so that the new program and its children share the same PID namespace and are visible to each other. If \fB\-\-no\-fork\fP is used, the new program will be exec\(cqed without forking. For further details, see \fBpid_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBuser namespace\fP
.RS 4
The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and capabilities. For further details, see \fBuser_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBcgroup namespace\fP
.RS 4
The process will have a virtualized view of \fI/proc/self/cgroup\fP, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted at the namespace cgroup root. For further details, see \fBcgroup_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.sp
\fBtime namespace\fP
.RS 4
The process can have a distinct view of \fBCLOCK_MONOTONIC\fP and/or \fBCLOCK_BOOTTIME\fP which can be changed using \fI/proc/self/timens_offsets\fP. For further details, see \fBtime_namespaces\fP(7).
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Various of the options below that relate to namespaces take an optional \fIfile\fP argument. This should be one of the \fI/proc/[pid]/ns/*\fP files described in \fBnamespaces\fP(7), or the pathname of a bind mount that was created on one of those files.
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Enter all namespaces of the target process by the default \fI/proc/[pid]/ns/*\fP namespace paths. The default paths to the target process namespaces may be overwritten by namespace specific options (e.g., \fB\-\-all \-\-mount\fP=[\fIpath\fP]).
.sp
The user namespace will be ignored if the same as the caller\(cqs current user namespace. It prevents a caller that has dropped capabilities from regaining those capabilities via a call to setns(). See \fBsetns\fP(2) for more details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-target\fP \fIPID\fP

.RE
.sp
\fB\-G\fP, \fB\-\-setgid\fP \fIgid\fP
.RS 4
Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace and drop supplementary groups. \fBnsenter\fP always sets GID for user namespaces, the default is 0.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-setuid\fP \fIuid\fP
.RS 4
Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace. \fBnsenter\fP always sets UID for user namespaces, the default is 0.

.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-root\fP[=\fIdirectory\fP]
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-wd\fP[=\fIdirectory\fP]
.RS 4
Set the working directory. If no directory is specified, set the working directory to the working directory of the target process. If directory is specified, set the working directory to the specified directory. The specified \fIdirectory\fP is open before it switches to the requested namespaces, it means the specified directory works as "tunnel" to the current namespace. See also \fB\-\-wdns\fP.

\fB\-W\fP, \fB\-\-wdns\fP[=\fIdirectory\fP]

.sp
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-no\-fork\fP
.RS 4
Do not fork before exec\(cqing the specified program. By default, when entering a PID namespace, \fBnsenter\fP calls \fBfork\fP before calling \fBexec\fP so that any children will also be in the newly entered PID namespace.

\fB\-Z\fP, \fB\-\-follow\-context\fP
.RS 4
Set the SELinux security context used for executing a new process according to already running process specified by \fB\-\-target\fP PID. (The util\-linux has to be compiled with SELinux support otherwise the option is unavailable.)
