.SH "NAME"
fincore \- count pages of file contents in core
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfincore\fP [options] \fIfile\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfincore\fP counts pages of file contents being resident in memory (in core), and reports the numbers. If an error occurs during counting, then an error message is printed to the stderr and \fBfincore\fP continues processing the rest of files listed in a command line.
.sp
The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always explicitly define expected columns by using \fB\-\-output\fP \fIcolumns\-list\fP in environments where a stable output is required.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-noheadings\fP
.RS 4
Do not print a header line in status output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bytes\fP
.RS 4
Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human\-readable format.
.sp
By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit prefixes are in
power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are exhibited truncated in order
to reach a better readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M",
then omitting on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIlist\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-raw\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
