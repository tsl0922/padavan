.SH "NAME"
lslocks \- list local system locks
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBlslocks\fP [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBlslocks\fP lists information about all the currently held file locks in a Linux system.
.sp
Note that lslocks also lists OFD (Open File Description) locks, these locks are not associated with any process (PID is \-1). OFD locks are associated with the open file description on which they are acquired. This lock type is available since Linux 3.15, see \fBfcntl\fP(2) for more details.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bytes\fP
.RS 4
Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human\-readable format.
.sp
By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit prefixes are in
power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are exhibited truncated in order
to reach a better readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M",
then omitting on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-noinaccessible\fP
.RS 4
Ignore lock files which are inaccessible for the current user.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-J\fP, \fB\-\-json\fP
.RS 4
Use JSON output format.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-noheadings\fP
.RS 4
Do not print a header line.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIlist\fP
.RS 4
Specify which output columns to print. Use \fB\-\-help\fP to get a list of all supported columns.
.sp
The default list of columns may be extended if \fIlist\fP is specified in the format \fI+list\fP (e.g., \fBlslocks \-o +BLOCKER\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-output\-all\fP
.RS 4
Output all available columns.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pid\fP \fIpid\fP
.RS 4
Display only the locks held by the process with this \fIpid\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-raw\fP
.RS 4
Use the raw output format.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-notruncate\fP
.RS 4
Do not truncate text in columns.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP

Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT"
.sp
COMMAND
.RS 4
The command name of the process holding the lock.
.RE
.sp
PID
.RS 4
The process ID of the process which holds the lock or \-1 for OFDLCK.
.RE
.sp
TYPE
.RS 4
The type of lock; can be FLOCK (created with \fBflock\fP(2)), POSIX (created with \fBfcntl\fP(2) and \fBlockf\fP(3)) or OFDLCK (created with \fBfcntl\fP(2)).
.RE
.sp
SIZE
.RS 4
Size of the locked file.
.RE
.sp
MODE
.RS 4
The lock\(cqs access permissions (read, write). If the process is blocked and waiting for the lock, then the mode is postfixed with an \(aq*\(aq (asterisk).
.RE
.sp
M
.RS 4
Whether the lock is mandatory; 0 means no (meaning the lock is only advisory), 1 means yes. (See \fBfcntl\fP(2).)
.RE
.sp
START
.RS 4
Relative byte offset of the lock.
.RE
.sp
END
.RS 4
Ending offset of the lock.
.RE
.sp
PATH
.RS 4
Full path of the lock. If none is found, or there are no permissions to read the path, it will fall back to the device\(cqs mountpoint and "..." is appended to the path. The path might be truncated; use \fB\-\-notruncate\fP to get the full path.
.RE
.sp
BLOCKER
.RS 4
The PID of the process which blocks the lock.
