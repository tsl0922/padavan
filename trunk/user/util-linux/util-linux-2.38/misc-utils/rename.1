.SH "NAME"
rename \- rename files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrename\fP [options] \fIexpression replacement file\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrename\fP will rename the specified files by replacing the first occurrence of \fIexpression\fP in their name by \fIreplacement\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-symlink\fP
.RS 4
Do not rename a symlink but its target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Show which files were renamed, if any.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-act\fP

.RE
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Replace all occurrences of \fIexpression\fP rather than only the first one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-last\fP
.RS 4
Replace the last occurrence of \fIexpression\fP rather than the first one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-no\-overwrite\fP

.RE
.SH "WARNING"
.sp
The renaming has no safeguards by default or without any one of the options \fB\-\-no\-overwrite\fP, \fB\-\-interactive\fP or \fB\-\-no\-act\fP. If the user has permission to rewrite file names, the command will perform the action without any questions. For example, the result can be quite drastic when the command is run as root in the \fI/lib\fP directory. Always make a backup before running the command, unless you truly know what you are doing.
.SH "INTERACTIVE MODE"
.sp
As most standard utilities rename can be used with a terminal device (tty in short) in canonical mode, where the line is buffered by the tty and you press ENTER to validate the user input. If you put your tty in cbreak mode however, rename requires only a single key press to answer the prompt. To set cbreak mode, run for example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
sh \-c \(aqstty \-icanon min 1; "$0" "$@"; stty icanon\(aq rename \-i from to files
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
