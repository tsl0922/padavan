.SH "NAME"
colcrt \- filter nroff output for CRT previewing
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcolcrt\fP [options] [\fIfile\fP ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBcolcrt\fP provides virtual half\-line and reverse line feed sequences for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is destructive. Half\-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `\-\(aq) are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-\fP, \fB\-\-no\-underlining\fP
.RS 4
Suppress all underlining. This option is especially useful for previewing \fIallboxed\fP tables from \fBtbl\fP(1).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-2\fP, \fB\-\-half\-lines\fP
.RS 4
Causes all half\-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the output. Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty lines. The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however. The \fB\-2\fP option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be partially invisible.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
The \fBcolcrt\fP command appeared in 3.0BSD.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the \fB\-\fP option so that a true underline character would show.
.sp
Can\(cqt back up more than 102 lines.
.sp
General overstriking is lost; as a special case \(aq|\(aq overstruck with \(aq\-\(aq or underline becomes \(aq+\(aq.
.sp
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
.sp
Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts in documents which are already double\-spaced.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
