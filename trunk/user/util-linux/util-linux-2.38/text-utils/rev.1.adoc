== NAME

rev - reverse lines characterwise

== SYNOPSIS

*rev* [option] [_file_...]

== DESCRIPTION

The *rev* utility copies the specified files to standard output, reversing the order of characters in every line. If no files are specified, standard input is read.

This utility is a line-oriented tool and it uses in-memory allocated buffer for a whole wide-char line. If the input file is huge and without line breaks then allocating the memory for the file may be unsuccessful.
