== NAME

more - file perusal filter for crt viewing

== SYNOPSIS

*more* [options] _file_ ...

== DESCRIPTION

*more* is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time. This version is especially primitive. Users should realize that *less*(1) provides *more*(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.

== OPTIONS

Options are also taken from the environment variable *MORE* (make sure to precede them with a dash (*-*)) but command-line options will override those.

*-d*, *--silent*::
Prompt with "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]", and display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.

*-l*, *--logical*::
Do not pause after any line containing a *^L* (form feed).

*-e*, *--exit-on-eof*::
Exit on End-Of-File, enabled by default if not executed on terminal.

*-f*, *--no-pause*::
Count logical lines, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).

*-p*, *--print-over*::
Do not scroll. Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text. Notice that this option is switched on automatically if the executable is named *page*.

*-c*, *--clean-print*::
Do not scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

*-s*, *--squeeze*::
Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

*-u*, *--plain*::
Suppress underlining. This option is silently ignored as backwards compatibility.

*-n*, *--lines* _number_::
Specify the _number_ of lines per screenful. The _number_ argument is a positive decimal integer. The *--lines* option shall override any values obtained from any other source, such as number of lines reported by terminal.

**-**__number__::
A numeric option means the same as *--lines* option argument.

**+**__number__::
Start displaying each file at line _number_.

**+**/__string__::
The _string_ to be searched in each file before starting to display it.

== COMMANDS

Interactive commands for *more* are based on *vi*(1). Some commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below. In the following descriptions, *^X* means *control-X*.

*h* or *?*::
Help; display a summary of these commands. If you forget all other commands, remember this one.

*SPACE*::
Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen size.

*z*::
Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen size. Argument becomes new default.

*RETURN*::
Display next k lines of text. Defaults to 1. Argument becomes new default.

*d* or *^D*::
Scroll k lines. Default is current scroll size, initially 11. Argument becomes new default.

*q* or *Q* or *INTERRUPT*::
Exit.

*s*::
Skip forward k lines of text. Defaults to 1.

*f*::
Skip forward k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1.

*b* or *^B*::
Skip backwards k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1. Only works with files, not pipes.

*'*::
Go to the place where the last search started.

*=*::
Display current line number.

*/pattern*::
Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to 1.

*n*::
Search for kth occurrence of last regular expression. Defaults to 1.

*!command* or *:!command*::
Execute _command_ in a subshell.

*v*::
Start up an editor at current line. The editor is taken from the environment variable *VISUAL* if defined, or *EDITOR* if *VISUAL* is not defined, or defaults to *vi*(1) if neither *VISUAL* nor *EDITOR* is defined.

*^L*::
Redraw screen.

*:n*::
Go to kth next file. Defaults to 1.

*:p*::
Go to kth previous file. Defaults to 1.

*:f*::
Display current file name and line number.

*.*::
Repeat previous command.

== ENVIRONMENT

The *more* command respects the following environment variables, if they exist:

*MORE*::
This variable may be set with favored options to *more*.

*SHELL*::
Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login time).

*TERM*::
The terminal type used by *more* to get the terminal characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.

*VISUAL*::
The editor the user prefers. Invoked when command key _v_ is pressed.

*EDITOR*::
The editor of choice when *VISUAL* is not specified.

== HISTORY

The *more* command appeared in 3.0BSD. This man page documents *more* version 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the Linux community. Documentation was produced using several other versions of the man page, and extensive inspection of the source code.

== AUTHORS

Eric Shienbrood, UC Berkeley.

Modified by Geoff Peck, UCB to add underlining, single spacing.

Modified by John Foderaro, UCB to add -c and MORE environment variable.
