== NAME

chsh - change your login shell

== SYNOPSIS

*chsh* [*-s* _shell_] [*-l*] [*-h*] [*-v*] [_username_]

== DESCRIPTION

*chsh* is used to change your login shell. If a shell is not given on the command line, *chsh* prompts for one.

*chsh* supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked with libuser, otherwise use *ypchsh*(1), *lchsh*(1) or any other implementation for non-local entries.

== OPTIONS

*-s*, *--shell* _shell_::
Specify your login shell.

*-l*, *--list-shells*::
Print the list of shells listed in _/etc/shells_ and exit.

include::man-common/help-version.adoc[]

== VALID SHELLS

*chsh* will accept the full pathname of any executable file on the system.

The default behavior for non-root users is to accept only shells listed in the _/etc/shells_ file, and issue a warning for root user. It can also be configured at compile-time to only issue a warning for all users.

== EXIT STATUS

Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.
