.SH "NAME"
lslogins \- display information about known users in the system
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBlslogins\fP [options] [\fB\-s\fP|\fB\-u\fP[=\fIUID\fP]] [\fB\-g\fP \fIgroups\fP] [\fB\-l\fP \fIlogins\fP] [\fIusername\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Examine the wtmp and btmp logs, \fI/etc/shadow\fP (if necessary) and \fI/passwd\fP and output the desired data.
.sp
The optional argument \fIusername\fP forces \fBlslogins\fP to print all available details about the specified user only. In this case the output format is different than in case of \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-g\fP and unknown is \fIusername\fP reported as an error.
.sp
The default action is to list info about all the users in the system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-acc\-expiration\fP
.RS 4

.sp
Note that the relation between user and group may be invisible for the primary group if the user is not explicitly specified as group member (e.g., in \fI/etc/group\fP). If the command \fBlslogins\fP scans for groups then it uses the groups database only, and the user database with primary GID is not used at all.

The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed for shell variable identifiers. This is usable, for example, with \fB\-\-export\fP.
