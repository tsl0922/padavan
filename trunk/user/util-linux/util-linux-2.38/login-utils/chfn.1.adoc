== NAME

chfn - change your finger information

== SYNOPSIS

*chfn* [*-f* _full-name_] [*-o* _office_] [*-p* _office-phone_] [*-h* _home-phone_] [*-u*] [*-v*] [_username_]

== DESCRIPTION

*chfn* is used to change your finger information. This information is stored in the _/etc/passwd_ file, and is displayed by the *finger* program. The Linux *finger* command will display four pieces of information that can be changed by *chfn*: your real name, your work room and phone, and your home phone.

Any of the four pieces of information can be specified on the command line. If no information is given on the command line, *chfn* enters interactive mode.

In interactive mode, *chfn* will prompt for each field. At a prompt, you can enter the new information, or just press return to leave the field unchanged. Enter the keyword "none" to make the field blank.

*chfn* supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked with libuser, otherwise use *ypchfn*(1), *lchfn*(1) or any other implementation for non-local entries.

== OPTIONS

*-f*, *--full-name* _full-name_::
Specify your real name.

*-o*, *--office* _office_::
Specify your office room number.

*-p*, *--office-phone* _office-phone_::
Specify your office phone number.

*-h*, *--home-phone* _home-phone_::
Specify your home phone number.

== CONFIG FILE ITEMS

*chfn* reads the _/etc/login.defs_ configuration file (see *login.defs*(5)). Note that the configuration file could be distributed with another package (e.g., shadow-utils). The following configuration items are relevant for *chfn*:

*CHFN_RESTRICT* _string_::

Indicate which fields are changeable by *chfn*.
+
The boolean setting *"yes"* means that only the Office, Office Phone and Home Phone fields are changeable, and boolean setting *"no"* means that also the Full Name is changeable.
+
Another way to specify changeable fields is by abbreviations: f = Full Name, r = Office (room), w = Office (work) Phone, h = Home Phone. For example, *CHFN_RESTRICT "wh"* allows changing work and home phone numbers.
+
If *CHFN_RESTRICT* is undefined, then all finger information is read-only. This is the default.

== EXIT STATUS

Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.
