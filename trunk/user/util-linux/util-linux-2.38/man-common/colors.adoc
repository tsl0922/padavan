== COLORS

The output colorization is implemented by *terminal-colors.d*(5) functionality.
Implicit coloring can be disabled by an empty file
____
_/etc/terminal-colors.d/{command}.disable_
____
for the *{command}* command or for all tools by
____
_/etc/terminal-colors.d/disable_
____
The user-specific _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal-colors.d_
or _$HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d_ overrides the global setting. 

Note that the output colorization may be enabled by default, and in this case
_terminal-colors.d_ directories do not have to exist yet.
