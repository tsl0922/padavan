# Be careful with number of processes. Don't forget that there is time limit
# when the mount waits on the mtab lock. If you define too much processes some
# of them will fail with timeout.
#
# Note: the original version (< 2.13) of util-linux is completely useless for
# this test (maximum for this old version is NLOOPS=10 and NPROCESSES=5 (2-way
# 2GHz machine)). It has terrible performance due a bad timeouts implementation
# in lock_mtab().
