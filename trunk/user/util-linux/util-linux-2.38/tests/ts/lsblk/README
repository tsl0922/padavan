Howto add new lsblk test:

* run mk-input.sh <testname>

* copy testname.tar.xz file to tests/ts/lsblk/dumps

* copy lsblk-* files from the tarball to tests/expected/lsblk/

* run ./tests/run.sh lsblk

* git add tests/ts/lsblk/testname.tar.xz
  git add tests/expected/lsblk/lsblk-testname*


Note that we do not use directly lsblk-* from the tarball. It's better to keep
copy of the files in the tests/expected/lsblk/, because output formatting may
be different in the current version. The version in the tarball is just initial
hint only.
