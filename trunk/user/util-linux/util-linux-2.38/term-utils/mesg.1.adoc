== NAME

mesg - display (or do not display) messages from other users

== SYNOPSIS

*mesg* [_option_] [*n*|*y*]

== DESCRIPTION

The *mesg* utility is invoked by a user to control write access others have to the terminal device associated with standard error output. If write access is allowed, then programs such as *talk*(1) and *write*(1) may display messages on the terminal.

Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to remove write access by default, at least for the primary login shell. To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them to be set, *mesg* should be executed in your login scripts.

The *mesg* utility silently exits with error status 2 if not executed on terminal. In this case execute *mesg* is pointless. The command line option *--verbose* forces mesg to print a warning in this situation. This behaviour has been introduced in version 2.33.

== ARGUMENTS

*n*::
Disallow messages.

*y*::
Allow messages to be displayed.

If no arguments are given, *mesg* shows the current message status on standard error output.

== OPTIONS

*-v*, *--verbose*::
Explain what is being done.

== EXIT STATUS
