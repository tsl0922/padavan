== NAME

scriptlive - re-run session typescripts, using timing information

== SYNOPSIS

*scriptlive* [options] [*-t*] _timingfile_ [*-I*|*-B*] _typescript_

== DESCRIPTION

This program re-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and timing information to ensure that input happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

The *session is executed* in a newly created pseudoterminal with the user's $SHELL (or defaults to _/bin/bash_).

*Be careful!* Do not forget that the typescript may contains arbitrary commands. It is recommended to use *"scriptreplay --stream in --log-in typescript"* (or with *--log-io* instead of *--log-in*) to verify the typescript before it is executed by *scriptlive*.

The timing information is what *script*(1) outputs to file specified by *--log-timing*. The typescript has to contain stdin information and it is what script1 outputs to file specified by *--log-in* or *--log-io*.

== OPTIONS

*-I*, *--log-in* _file_::
File containing *script*'s terminal input.

*-B*, *--log-io* _file_::
File containing *script*'s terminal output and input.

*-t*, *--timing* _file_::
File containing *script*'s timing output. This option overrides old-style arguments.

*-T*, *--log-timing* _file_::
Aliased to *-t*, maintained for compatibility with *script*(1) command-line options.

*-d*, *--divisor* _number_::
Speed up the replay displaying this _number_ of times. The argument is a floating-point number. It's called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old-style arguments.

*-m*, *--maxdelay* _number_::
Set the maximum delay between updates to _number_ of seconds. The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
