\fBsfdisk\fP [options] \fIcommand\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBsfdisk\fP is a script\-oriented tool for partitioning any block device. It runs in interactive mode if executed on a terminal (stdin refers to a terminal).
.sp
Since version 2.26 \fBsfdisk\fP supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI disk labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS (Cylinder\-Head\-Sector) addressing. CHS has never been important for Linux, and this addressing concept does not make any sense for new devices.
.sp
\fBsfdisk\fP protects the first disk sector when create a new disk label. The option \fB\-\-wipe always\fP disables this protection. Note that \fBfdisk\fP(8) and \fBcfdisk\fP(8) completely erase this area by default.
.sp
\fBsfdisk\fP (since version 2.26) \fBaligns the start and end of partitions\fP to block\-device I/O limits when relative sizes are specified, when the default values are used or when multiplicative suffixes (e.g., MiB) are used for sizes. It is possible that partition size will be optimized (reduced or enlarged) due to alignment if the start offset is specified exactly in sectors and partition size relative or by multiplicative suffixes.
.sp
The recommended way is not to specify start offsets at all and specify partition size in MiB, GiB (or so). In this case \fBsfdisk\fP aligns all partitions to block\-device I/O limits (or when I/O limits are too small then to megabyte boundary to keep disk layout portable). If this default behaviour is unwanted (usually for very small partitions) then specify offsets and sizes in sectors. In this case \fBsfdisk\fP entirely follows specified numbers without any optimization.
.sp
\fBsfdisk\fP does not create the standard system partitions for SGI and SUN disk labels like \fBfdisk\fP(8) does. It is necessary to explicitly create all partitions including whole\-disk system partitions.
.sp
\fBsfdisk\fP uses \fBBLKRRPART\fP (reread partition table) ioctl to make sure that the device is not used by system or other tools (see also \fB\-\-no\-reread\fP). It\(cqs possible that this feature or another \fBsfdisk\fP activity races with \fBsystemd\-udevd\fP(8). The recommended way how to avoid possible collisions is to use \fB\-\-lock\fP option. The exclusive lock will cause \fBsystemd\-udevd\fP to skip the event handling on the device.
.sp
The \fBsfdisk\fP prompt is only a hint for users and a displayed partition number does not mean that the same partition table entry will be created (if \fB\-N\fP not specified), especially for tables with gaps.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
The commands are mutually exclusive.
.sp
[\fB\-N\fP \fIpartition\-number\fP] \fIdevice\fP
.RS 4
The default \fBsfdisk\fP command is to read the specification for the desired partitioning of \fIdevice\fP from standard input, and then create a partition table according to the specification. See below for the description of the input format. If standard input is a terminal, then \fBsfdisk\fP starts an interactive session.
.sp
If the option \fB\-N\fP is specified, then the changes are applied to the partition addressed by \fIpartition\-number\fP. The unspecified fields of the partition are not modified.
.sp
Note that it\(cqs possible to address an unused partition with \fB\-N\fP. For example, an MBR always contains 4 partitions, but the number of used partitions may be smaller. In this case \fBsfdisk\fP follows the default values from the partition table and does not use built\-in defaults for the unused partition given with \fB\-N\fP. See also \fB\-\-append\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-activate\fP \fIdevice\fP [\fIpartition\-number\fP...]
.RS 4
Switch on the bootable flag for the specified partitions and switch off the bootable flag on all unspecified partitions. The special placeholder \(aq\-\(aq may be used instead of the partition numbers to switch off the bootable flag on all partitions.
.sp
The activation command is supported for MBR and PMBR only. If a GPT label is detected, then \fBsfdisk\fP prints warning and automatically enters PMBR.
.sp
If no \fIpartition\-number\fP is specified, then list the partitions with an enabled flag.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-backup\-pt\-sectors\fP \fIdevice\fP
.RS 4
Back up the current partition table sectors in binary format and exit. See the \fBBACKING UP THE PARTITION TABLE\fP section.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-delete\fP \fIdevice\fP [\fIpartition\-number\fP...]
.RS 4
Delete all or the specified partitions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dump\fP \fIdevice\fP
.RS 4
Dump the partitions of a device in a format that is usable as input to \fBsfdisk\fP. See the \fBBACKING UP THE PARTITION TABLE\fP section.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-show\-geometry\fP [\fIdevice\fP...]
.RS 4
List the geometry of all or the specified devices. For backward compatibility the deprecated option \fB\-\-show\-pt\-geometry\fP have the same meaning as this one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-J\fP, \fB\-\-json\fP \fIdevice\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-list\-free\fP [\fIdevice\fP...]
.RS 4
List the free unpartitioned areas on all or the specified devices.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-part\-attrs\fP \fIdevice partition\-number\fP [\fIattributes\fP]
.RS 4
Change the GPT partition attribute bits. If \fIattributes\fP is not specified, then print the current partition settings. The \fIattributes\fP argument is a comma\- or space\-delimited list of bits numbers or bit names. For example, the string "RequiredPartition,50,51" sets three bits. The currently supported attribute bits are:
.sp
\fBBit 0 (RequiredPartition)\fP
.RS 4
If this bit is set, the partition is required for the platform to function. The creator of the partition indicates that deletion or modification of the contents can result in loss of platform features or failure for the platform to boot or operate. The system cannot function normally if this partition is removed, and it should be considered part of the hardware of the system.
.RE
.sp
\fBBit 1 (NoBlockIOProtocol)\fP
.RS 4
EFI firmware should ignore the content of the partition and not try to read from it.
.RE
.sp
\fBBit 2 (LegacyBIOSBootable)\fP
.RS 4
The partition may be bootable by legacy BIOS firmware.
.RE
.sp
\fBBits 3\-47\fP
.RS 4
Undefined and must be zero. Reserved for expansion by future versions of the UEFI specification.
.RE
.sp
\fBBits 48\-63\fP
.RS 4
Reserved for GUID specific use. The use of these bits will vary depending on the partition type. For example Microsoft uses bit 60 to indicate read\-only, 61 for shadow copy of another partition, 62 for hidden partitions and 63 to disable automount.
.RE
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-part\-label\fP \fIdevice partition\-number\fP [\fIlabel\fP]
.RS 4
Change the GPT partition name (label). If \fIlabel\fP is not specified, then print the current partition label.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-part\-type\fP \fIdevice partition\-number\fP [\fItype\fP]
.RS 4
Change the partition type. If \fItype\fP is not specified, then print the current partition type.
.sp
The \fItype\fP argument is hexadecimal for MBR, GUID for GPT, type alias (e.g. "linux") or type shortcut (e.g. \(aqL\(aq). For backward compatibility the options \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-\-id\fP have the same meaning as this one.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-part\-uuid\fP \fIdevice partition\-number\fP [\fIuuid\fP]
.RS 4
Change the GPT partition UUID. If \fIuuid\fP is not specified, then print the current partition UUID.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-disk\-id\fP \fIdevice\fP [\fIid\fP]
.RS 4

.RS 4
Renumber the partitions, ordering them by their start offset.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-show\-size\fP [\fIdevice\fP...]

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-relocate\fP \fIoper\fP \fIdevice\fP
.RS 4
Relocate partition table header. This command is currently supported for GPT header only. The argument \fIoper\fP can be:
.sp
\fBgpt\-bak\-std\fP
.RS 4
Move GPT backup header to the standard location at the end of the device.
.RE
.sp
\fBgpt\-bak\-mini\fP
.RS 4
Move GPT backup header behind the last partition. Note that UEFI standard requires the backup header at the end of the device and partitioning tools can automatically relocate the header to follow the standard.
.RE
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-append\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt create a new partition table, but only append the specified partitions.
.sp
Note that unused partition maybe be re\-used in this case although it is not the last partition in the partition table. See also \fB\-N\fP to specify entry in the partition table.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-backup\fP
.RS 4
Back up the current partition table sectors before starting the partitioning. The default backup file name is \fI~/sfdisk\-<device>\-<offset>.bak\fP; to use another name see option \fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-backup\-file\fP. See section \fBBACKING UP THE PARTITION TABLE\fP for more details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-color\fP[\fB=\fP\fIwhen\fP]
.RS 4
Colorize the output. The optional argument \fIwhen\fP can be \fBauto\fP, \fBnever\fP or \fBalways\fP. If the \fIwhen\fP argument is omitted, it defaults to \fBauto\fP. The colors can be disabled; for the current built\-in default see the \fB\-\-help\fP output. See also the \fBCOLORS\fP section.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP
.RS 4
Disable all consistency checking.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-Linux\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated and ignored option. Partitioning that is compatible with Linux (and other modern operating systems) is the default.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-lock\fP[=\fImode\fP]
.RS 4
Use exclusive BSD lock for device or file it operates. The optional argument \fImode\fP can be \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP (or 1 and 0) or \fBnonblock\fP. If the \fImode\fP argument is omitted, it defaults to \fByes\fP. This option overwrites environment variable \fB$LOCK_BLOCK_DEVICE\fP. The default is not to use any lock at all, but it\(cqs recommended to avoid collisions with \fBsystemd\-udevd\fP(8) or other tools.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-act\fP
.RS 4
Do everything except writing to the device.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-reread\fP

Do not check through the re\-read\-partition\-table ioctl whether the device is in use.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-tell\-kernel\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt tell the kernel about partition changes. This option is recommended together with \fB\-\-no\-reread\fP to modify a partition on used disk. The modified partition should not be used (e.g., mounted).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-backup\-file\fP \fIpath\fP
.RS 4
Override the default backup file name. Note that the device name and offset are always appended to the file name.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-move\-data\fP[\fB=\fP\fIpath\fP]
.RS 4
Move data after partition relocation, for example when moving the beginning of a partition to another place on the disk. The size of the partition has to remain the same, the new and old location may overlap. This option requires option \fB\-N\fP in order to be processed on one specific partition only.
.sp
The optional \fIpath\fP specifies log file name. The log file contains information about all read/write operations on the partition data. The word "@default" as a \fIpath\fP forces \fBsfdisk\fP to use \fI~/sfdisk\-<devname>.move\fP for the log. The log is optional since v2.35.
.sp
Note that this operation is risky and not atomic. \fBDon\(cqt forget to backup your data!\fP
.sp
See also \fB\-\-move\-use\-fsync\fP.
.sp
In the example below, the first command creates a 100MiB free area before the first partition and moves the data it contains (e.g., a filesystem), the next command creates a new partition from the free space (at offset 2048), and the last command reorders partitions to match disk order (the original sdc1 will become sdc2).

.sp
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-label\fP \fItype\fP
.RS 4
Specify the disk label type (e.g., \fBdos\fP, \fBgpt\fP, ...). If this option is not given, then \fBsfdisk\fP defaults to the existing label, but if there is no label on the device yet, then the type defaults to \fBdos\fP. The default or the current label may be overwritten by the "label: <name>" script header line. The option \fB\-\-label\fP does not force \fBsfdisk\fP to create empty disk label (see the \fBEMPTY DISK LABEL\fP section below).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-Y\fP, \fB\-\-label\-nested\fP \fItype\fP

Wipe filesystem, RAID and partition\-table signatures from the device, in order to avoid possible collisions. The argument \fIwhen\fP can be \fBauto\fP, \fBnever\fP or \fBalways\fP. When this option is not given, the default is \fBauto\fP, in which case signatures are wiped only when in interactive mode; except the old partition\-table signatures which are always wiped before create a new partition\-table if the argument \fIwhen\fP is not \fBnever\fP. The \fBauto\fP mode also does not wipe the first sector (boot sector), it is necessary to use the \fBalways\fP mode to wipe this area. In all cases detected signatures are reported by warning messages before a new partition table is created. See also the \fBwipefs\fP(8) command.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-W\fP, \fB\-\-wipe\-partitions\fP \fIwhen\fP

\fIstart size type bootable\fP

.RE
.ll
.sp
where each line fills one partition descriptor.
.sp
Fields are separated by whitespace, comma (recommended) or semicolon possibly followed by whitespace; initial and trailing whitespace is ignored. Numbers can be octal, decimal or hexadecimal; decimal is the default. When a field is absent, empty or specified as \(aq\-\(aq a default value is used. But when the \fB\-N\fP option (change a single partition) is given, the default for each field is its previous value.
.sp
The default value of \fIstart\fP is the first non\-assigned sector aligned according to device I/O limits. The default start offset for the first partition is 1 MiB. If the offset is followed by the multiplicative suffixes (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB), then the number is interpreted as offset in bytes. Since v2.38 when the \fB\-N\fP option (change a single partition) is given, a \(aq+\(aq can be used to enlarge partition by move start of the partition if there is a free space before the partition.
.sp
The default value of \fIsize\fP indicates "as much as possible"; i.e., until the next partition or end\-of\-device. A numerical argument is by default interpreted as a number of sectors, however if the size is followed by one of the multiplicative suffixes (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB) then the number is interpreted as the size of the partition in bytes and it is then aligned according to the device I/O limits. A \(aq+\(aq can be used instead of a number to enlarge the partition as much as possible. Note \(aq+\(aq is equivalent to the default behaviour for a new partition; existing partitions will be resized as required.
.sp
The partition \fItype\fP is given in hex for MBR (DOS) where 0x prefix is optional; a GUID string for GPT; a shortcut or an alias. It\(cqs recommended to use two letters for MBR hex codes to avoid collision between deprecated shortcut \(aqE\(aq and \(aq0E\(aq MBR hex code. For backward compatibility \fBsfdisk\fP tries to interpret \fItype\fP as a shortcut as a first possibility in partitioning scripts although on other places (e.g. \fB\-\-part\-type\fP command) it tries shortcuts as the last possibility.
.sp
Since v2.36 libfdisk supports partition type aliases as extension to shortcuts. The alias is a simple human readable word (e.g. "linux").
.sp
Since v2.37 libfdisk supports partition type names on input, ignoring the case of the characters and all non\-alphanumeric and non\-digit characters in the name (e.g. "Linux /usr x86" is the same as "linux usr\-x86").

.sp
Use the \fB\-\-dump\fP command to save a description of the device layout to a text file.
The dump format is suitable for later \fBsfdisk\fP input. For example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBsfdisk \-\-dump /dev/sda > sda.dump\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This can later be restored by:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBsfdisk /dev/sda < sda.dump\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.SS "Full binary backup"
.sp
If you want to do a full binary backup of all sectors where the partition table is stored, then use the \fB\-\-backup\-pt\-sectors\fP command. It writes the sectors to \fI~/sfdisk\-<device>\-<offset>.bak\fP files. The default name of the backup file can be changed with the \fB\-\-backup\-file\fP option. The backup files contain only raw data from the \fIdevice\fP. For example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBsfdisk \-\-backup\-pt\-sectors /dev/sda\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The GPT header can later be restored by:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBdd if=~/sfdisk\-sda\-0x00000200.bak of=/dev/sda seek=$((0x00000200)) bs=1 conv=notrunc\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
It\(cqs also possible to use the \fB\-\-backup\fP option to create the same backup immediately after startup for other \fBsfdisk\fP commands. For example, backup partition table before deleting all partitions from partition table:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fBsfdisk \-\-backup \-\-delete /dev/sda\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The same concept of backup files is used by \fBwipefs\fP(8).
.sp
Note that \fBsfdisk\fP since version 2.26 no longer provides the \fB\-I\fP option to restore sectors. \fBdd\fP(1) provides all necessary functionality.
.SH "COLORS"
.sp
The output colorization is implemented by \fBterminal\-colors.d\fP(5) functionality.
Implicit coloring can be disabled by an empty file
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fI/etc/terminal\-colors.d/sfdisk.disable\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
for the \fBsfdisk\fP command or for all tools by
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
\fI/etc/terminal\-colors.d/disable\fP
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
The user\-specific \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal\-colors.d\fP
or \fI$HOME/.config/terminal\-colors.d\fP overrides the global setting.
.sp
Note that the output colorization may be enabled by default, and in this case
\fIterminal\-colors.d\fP directories do not have to exist yet.
.sp
The logical color names supported by \fBsfdisk\fP are:
.sp
\fBheader\fP
.RS 4
The header of the output tables.
.RE
.sp
\fBwarn\fP
.RS 4
The warning messages.
.RE
.sp
\fBwelcome\fP
.RS 4
The welcome message.

.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
Since version 2.26 \fBsfdisk\fP no longer provides the \fB\-R\fP or \fB\-\-re\-read\fP option to force the kernel to reread the partition table. Use \fBblockdev \-\-rereadpt\fP instead.
.sp
Since version 2.26 \fBsfdisk\fP does not provide the \fB\-\-DOS\fP, \fB\-\-IBM\fP, \fB\-\-DOS\-extended\fP, \fB\-\-unhide\fP, \fB\-\-show\-extended\fP, \fB\-\-cylinders\fP, \fB\-\-heads\fP, \fB\-\-sectors\fP, \fB\-\-inside\-outer\fP, \fB\-\-not\-inside\-outer\fP options.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
\fBsfdisk \-\-list \-\-label\-nested=mbr /dev/sda\fP
