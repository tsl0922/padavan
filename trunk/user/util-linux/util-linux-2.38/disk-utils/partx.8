.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Given a device or disk\-image, \fBpartx\fP tries to parse the partition table and list its contents. It can also tell the kernel to add or remove partitions from its bookkeeping.
.sp
The \fIdisk\fP argument is optional when a \fIpartition\fP argument is provided. To force scanning a partition as if it were a whole disk (for example to list nested subpartitions), use the argument "\-" (hyphen\-minus). For example:
.RS 3
.ll -.6i
.sp
partx \-\-show \- /dev/sda3
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
This will see sda3 as a whole\-disk rather than as a partition.
.sp
\fBpartx is not an fdisk program\fP \- adding and removing partitions does not change the disk, it just tells the kernel about the presence and numbering of on\-disk partitions.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-add\fP
.RS 4
Add the specified partitions, or read the disk and add all partitions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bytes\fP
.RS 4
Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human\-readable format.
.sp
By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit prefixes are in
power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are exhibited truncated in order
to reach a better readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M",
then omitting on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-delete\fP
.RS 4
Delete the specified partitions or all partitions. It is not error to remove non\-existing partitions, so this option is possible to use together with large \fB\-\-nr\fP ranges without care about the current partitions set on the device.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-noheadings\fP
.RS 4
Do not print a header line with \fB\-\-show\fP or \fB\-\-raw\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP
.RS 4
List the partitions. Note that all numbers are in 512\-byte sectors. This output format is DEPRECATED in favour of \fB\-\-show\fP. Do not use it in newly written scripts.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-nr\fP \fIM\fP\fB:\fP\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Specify the range of partitions. For backward compatibility also the format \fIM\fP\fB\-\fP\fIN\fP is supported. The range may contain negative numbers, for example \fB\-\-nr \-1:\-1\fP means the last partition, and \fB\-\-nr \-2:\-1\fP means the last two partitions. Supported range specifications are:
.sp
\fIM\fP
.RS 4
Specifies just one partition (e.g. \fB\-\-nr 3\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fIM\fP\fB:\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the lower limit only (e.g. \fB\-\-nr 2:\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fB:\fP\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the upper limit only (e.g. \fB\-\-nr :4\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fIM\fP\fB:\fP\fIN\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the lower and upper limits (e.g. \fB\-\-nr 2:4\fP).
.RE
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIlist\fP
.RS 4
Define the output columns to use for \fB\-\-show\fP, \fB\-\-pairs\fP and \fB\-\-raw\fP output. If no output arrangement is specified, then a default set is used. Use \fB\-\-help\fP to get \fIlist\fP of all supported columns. This option cannot be combined with the \fB\-\-add\fP, \fB\-\-delete\fP, \fB\-\-update\fP or \fB\-\-list\fP options.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-output\-all\fP
.RS 4
Output all available columns.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-\-pairs\fP
.RS 4
List the partitions using the KEY="value" format.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-raw\fP
.RS 4
List the partitions using the raw output format.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-show\fP
.RS 4
List the partitions. The output columns can be selected and rearranged with the \fB\-\-output\fP option. All numbers (except SIZE) are in 512\-byte sectors.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-type\fP \fItype\fP
.RS 4
Specify the partition table type.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-list\-types\fP
.RS 4
List supported partition types and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-update\fP
.RS 4
Update the specified partitions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-sector\-size\fP \fIsize\fP
.RS 4
Overwrite default sector size.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Verbose mode.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Print version and exit.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
LIBBLKID_DEBUG=all
.RS 4
enables libblkid debug output.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
partx \-\-show /dev/sdb3, partx \-\-show \-\-nr 3 /dev/sdb, partx \-\-show /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdb
.RS 4
All three commands list partition 3 of \fI/dev/sdb\fP.
.RE
.sp
partx \-\-show \- /dev/sdb3
.RS 4
Lists all subpartitions on \fI/dev/sdb3\fP (the device is used as whole\-disk).
.RE
.sp
partx \-o START \-g \-\-nr 5 /dev/sdb
.RS 4
Prints the start sector of partition 5 on \fI/dev/sdb\fP without header.
.RE
.sp
partx \-o SECTORS,SIZE /dev/sda5 /dev/sda
.RS 4
Lists the length in sectors and human\-readable size of partition 5 on \fI/dev/sda\fP.
.RE
.sp
partx \-\-add \-\-nr 3:5 /dev/sdd
.RS 4
Adds all available partitions from 3 to 5 (inclusive) on \fI/dev/sdd\fP.
.RE
.sp
partx \-d \-\-nr :\-1 /dev/sdd
.RS 4
Removes the last partition on \fI/dev/sdd\fP.
