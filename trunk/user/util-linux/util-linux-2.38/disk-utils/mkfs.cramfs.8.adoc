== NAME

mkfs.cramfs - make compressed ROM file system

== SYNOPSIS

*mkfs.cramfs* [options] _directory file_

== DESCRIPTION

Files on cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a time to allow random read access. The metadata is not compressed, but is expressed in a terse representation that is more space-efficient than conventional file systems.

The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its design; random write access for compressed files is difficult to implement. cramfs ships with a utility (*mkcramfs*(8)) to pack files into new cramfs images.

File sizes are limited to less than 16 MB.

Maximum file system size is a little under 272 MB. (The last file on the file system must begin before the 256 MB block, but can extend past it.)

== ARGUMENTS

The _directory_ is simply the root of the directory tree that we want to generate a compressed filesystem out of.

The _file_ will contain the cram file system, which later can be mounted.

== OPTIONS

*-v*::
Enable verbose messaging.

*-E*::
Treat all warnings as errors, which are reflected as command exit status.

*-b* _blocksize_::
Use defined block size, which has to be divisible by page size.

*-e* _edition_::
Use defined file system edition number in superblock.

*-N* _big, little, host_::
Use defined endianness. Value defaults to _host_.

*-i* _file_::
Insert a _file_ to cramfs file system.

*-n* _name_::
Set name of the cramfs file system.

*-p*::
Pad by 512 bytes for boot code.

*-s*::
This option is ignored. Originally the *-s* turned on directory entry sorting.

*-z*::
Make explicit holes.
