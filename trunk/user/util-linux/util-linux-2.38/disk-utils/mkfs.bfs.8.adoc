== NAME

mkfs.bfs - make an SCO bfs filesystem

== SYNOPSIS

*mkfs.bfs* [options] _device_ [_block-count_]

== DESCRIPTION

*mkfs.bfs* creates an SCO bfs filesystem on a block device (usually a disk partition or a file accessed via the loop device).

The _block-count_ parameter is the desired size of the filesystem, in blocks. If nothing is specified, the entire partition will be used.

== OPTIONS

*-N*, *--inodes* _number_::
Specify the desired _number_ of inodes (at most 512). If nothing is specified, some default number in the range 48-512 is picked depending on the size of the partition.

*-V*, *--vname* _label_::
Specify the volume _label_. I have no idea if/where this is used.

*-F*, *--fname* _name_::
Specify the filesystem _name_. I have no idea if/where this is used.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
Explain what is being done.

*-c*::
This option is silently ignored.

*-l*::
