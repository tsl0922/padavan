== NAME

uuid_unparse - convert a UUID from binary representation to a string

== SYNOPSIS

*#include <uuid.h>*

*void uuid_unparse(uuid_t __uu__, char *__out__);* +
*void uuid_unparse_upper(uuid_t __uu__, char *__out__);* +
*void uuid_unparse_lower(uuid_t __uu__, char *__out__);*

== DESCRIPTION

The *uuid_unparse*() function converts the supplied UUID _uu_ from the binary representation into a 36-byte string (plus trailing '\0') of the form 1b4e28ba-2fa1-11d2-883f-0016d3cca427 and stores this value in the character string pointed to by _out_. The case of the hex digits returned by *uuid_unparse*() may be upper or lower case, and is dependent on the system-dependent local default.

If the case of the hex digits is important then the functions *uuid_unparse_upper*() and *uuid_unparse_lower*() may be used.

== CONFORMING TO

This library unparses UUIDs compatible with OSF DCE 1.1.
