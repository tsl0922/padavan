== NAME

uuid_parse - convert an input UUID string into binary representation

== SYNOPSIS

*#include <uuid.h>*

*int uuid_parse(char *__in__, uuid_t __uu__);* +
*int uuid_parse_range(char *__in_start__, char *__in_end__, uuid_t __uu__);*

== DESCRIPTION

The *uuid_parse*() function converts the UUID string given by _in_ into the binary representation. The input UUID is a string of the form 1b4e28ba-2fa1-11d2-883f-b9a761bde3fb (in *printf*(3) format "%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x", 36 bytes plus the trailing '\0').

The *uuid_parse_range*() function works like *uuid_parse*() but parses only range in string specified by _in_start_ and _in_end_ pointers.

== RETURN VALUE

Upon successfully parsing the input string, 0 is returned, and the UUID is stored in the location pointed to by _uu_, otherwise -1 is returned.

== CONFORMING TO

This library parses UUIDs compatible with OSF DCE 1.1, and hash based UUIDs V3 and V5 compatible with link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122[RFC-4122].
